<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>These lectures have been given perhaps
half a dozen times, in England, in Switzerland
and in Germany. On allowing them to
appear in print I should perhaps apologize
to my readers for the somewhat free and
familiar style in which parts of them are
written; but even if I had the time to recast
them into a more serious form I should be
unwilling to do so, for there is surely enough
ponderous literature on the subject, and
although some may resent in a book what
often helps to make a lecture attractive, I
think I can rely on the fact that many
people agree with the dictum of Horace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10"><i>Ridiculum aeri</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fortius et melius magnas plerumque secat res,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or, as Milton has it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>Joking decides great things</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Stronger and better oft than earnest can.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Almost the only change that I have made
in my MS. has been the substitution or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
addition of an English translation in
numerous places where I had formerly
quoted the German original. On some
occasions, when first writing the lectures,
I very probably used the English version
of <i>Faust</i> by Bayard Taylor, but I have not
the book at present at hand and cannot feel
quite certain whether any of the verse
translations are not my own. The little
book makes of course no pretence to be
a contribution to critical or biographical
literature. It is meant especially for those
who wish to know something more about
the story of Faust and about Goethe's
play, and who, because their knowledge of
German does not suffice or for other reasons,
are unable to study the subject in any more
satisfactory way.</p>

<h2>I</h2>

<h3>THE OLD FAUST-LEGEND</h3>


<p>All of us have probably experienced the
fact that it is possible to have been familiar
for a long time with some great work of
imagination&mdash;some poem or picture&mdash;to
have learnt to love it almost as if it were a
living person, to imagine that we understand
it and appreciate it fully, even to fancy that
it has a special message, a deeper meaning,
for us than for almost any one else, and
then to come across somebody&mdash;some commentator
perhaps&mdash;who informs us that our
uncritical appreciation is quite worthless,
mere shallow sentiment, and that until we
can accurately analyze and formulate the
Idea which the artist endeavoured to incorporate
in his work, and classify the diverse
manifestations of this Idea as subjective,
objective, symbolical, allegorical, dramatical-psychological
or psychological-dramatical,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
we are not entitled to hold, far less to express,
any opinion on the subject.</p>

<p>When I realised that I had undertaken
to lecture on <i>Faust</i>, I thought it my duty to
study Goethe's German commentators&mdash;some
of them at least; for to study all
would consume a lifetime. A few of the
works of these commentators I already
possessed&mdash;some, I am sorry to say, with
their pages yet uncut. Others I procured,
following the advice of German friends well
versed in the matter. I set to work on what
was presumably the best of these commentaries.
As I laboured onwards, page after
page, I found myself from time to time
turning back to the title of the book. Sure
enough, it was <i>Ueber Goethe's Faust</i>. I
laboured on&mdash;the suspicion deepening at
every turn of the page that perhaps the
binder might have bound up the wrong text
under the title <i>Ueber Goethe's Faust</i>. At
the fifty-third page I came to a dead stop.
Except quite incidentally neither Goethe
nor Faust had as yet been mentioned. These
fifty-three pages had been entirely devoted
to what seemed to my rather unmetaphysical
mind a not very luminous or edifying dissertation
on the difference between <i>Ansicht</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and <i>Einsicht</i>&mdash;between mere Opinion and
true critical Insight; and, as far as I could
discover, the only conclusion as yet arrived
at was that the writer possessed an exclusive
monopoly in the last-mentioned article.</p>

<p>But I will not inflict upon you any
further description of my tusslings with
Teutonic interpreters of <i>Faust</i>&mdash;with their
<i>egos</i> and <i>non-egos</i>, their moral-&aelig;sthetic
symbolisms and so on. Let us leave them
to the tender mercies of Goethe himself,
who was not sparing of his ridicule in regard
to his commentators, nor, alas, at times in
regard to his countrymen. 'Of all nations,'
he says, 'the Germans understand me least.... Such
people make life a burden by their
abstruse thoughts and their <i>Ideas</i>, which
they hunt up in all directions and insist on
discovering in everything.... They come
and ask <i>me</i> what "Ideas" <i>I</i> have incorporated
in my <i>Faust</i>. Just as if I myself
knew!&mdash;or could describe it, even if I did
know!' Of course Goethe's great poem
contains an Idea, if by that word we mean in
a poem what we mean by <i>life</i> in anything
living; but it is not by dissection and
analysis that we shall discover it. 'He who
wishes,' says Goethe in <i>Faust</i>, 'to examine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and describe anything living first does his
best to expel the life. Then he has got the
dead parts in his hand; but what is wanting
is just the spiritual bond.' It is my purpose&mdash;a
purpose not easy of fulfilment&mdash;to avoid
this method of dissection and to place
before you living realities, not anatomical
specimens.</p>

<p>But before we plunge <i>in medias res</i> and
grapple our present subject, namely the old
Faust-legend, I should like to say just a few
words in order to show from what standpoint
I think we should regard Goethe as a
poet and a thinker&mdash;for that he is great both
as a poet and as a thinker cannot be denied.</p>

<p>Goethe describes his own philosophy as
the philosophy of action. He believed in
impulse, in inspiration, in action, rather
than in reflexion, analysis and logic. 'Reflect
not!' he makes Iphigenie exclaim&mdash;'Reflect
not! Grant freely, as thou feel'st!' And
in one of his Epigrams he says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yes, that's the right way,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When we cannot say</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How we think. True thought</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Comes as a gift, unsought.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such theory of inspiration is thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Greek, reminding one of Plato's 'muse-inspired
madman' and of what Sophocles is
related to have said to Aeschylus; 'Thou,
Aeschylus, always dost the right thing&mdash;but
unconsciously (<span class='correction' title='all ouk eid&ocirc;s ge'>&#7936;&#955;&#955;&#900; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#949;&#7984;&#948;&#974;&#987; &#947;&#949;</span>).' Thus
it was also with Goethe. All intellectual
hobbies and shibboleths, all this endless
wearisome discussion and dissection and
analysis and criticism and bandying about of
<i>opinion</i>, which is the very life-breath of
modern intellectual existence and modern
journalistic literature, Goethe rejected, as
Plato had done in his <i>Phaedrus</i>, where he
makes Socrates call such things 'rotten
soul-fodder.'</p>

<p>'The whole! The whole!' was Goethe's
frequent exclamation&mdash;'life! action! being!&mdash;the
living whole, not the dead parts!' He
was for ever decrying mere thought, mere
intellect, mere cleverness. And yet of all
moderns what greater intellect, what greater
thinker, can we name than Goethe himself?
Seldom, perhaps never, has there existed a
mortal so many-sided. 'In such manifold
directions'&mdash;he wrote to his friend Jacobi&mdash;'does
my nature move, that I cannot be
satisfied with <i>one</i> single mode of thought.
As poet and artist I am polytheist; as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
student of Nature I am pantheist. When I
need a God for my personal nature, as a
moral and spiritual human being, He also
exists for me. Heaven and earth are such
an immense realm that it can only be
grasped by the collective intelligence of all
intelligent beings.' Such 'collective intelligence'
Goethe perhaps more nearly possessed
than any other human being has
done. The lordly pleasure-house which he
built for his soul was such as Tennyson
describes (and his words refer of course to
Goethe):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Full of great rooms and small the palace stood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>All various, each a perfect whole</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From living Nature, fit for every mood</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And change of my still soul.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And wonderfully true are those other
lines of Tennyson&mdash;but rather bitter, as
perhaps was to be expected of Tennyson
when he was describing a great character
with which he had so little sympathy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I take possession of man's mind and deed.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>I care not what the sects may brawl.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I sit as God holding no form of creed,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>But contemplating all.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To Goethe all things, both in Nature and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Art were but transitory reflexions of the
real and eternal. 'Alles verg&auml;ngliche ist
nur ein Gleichnis'&mdash;all things transitory
are but a parable, an allegory of truth and
reality&mdash;such are some of the last words of
his great Poem; and thus too he regarded
his own poetry. 'I have,' he said, 'always
regarded all that I have produced as merely
symbolic, and I did not much care whether
what I made were pots or dishes.' Even
that life-poem of his, <i>Faust</i>, which he
planned and began as a young man of about
twenty-five, and the last lines of which he
wrote a few months before his death, aged
eighty-two, only represents (as indeed do all
great works of art) <i>one</i> aspect of belief&mdash;or
perhaps I should rather say a certain number
of truth's innumerable aspects, none of them
claiming to afford a full vision, and not a few
of them apparently contradictory; for, as
both Plato and Shakespeare tell us, truth
cannot be directly stated: it lies, as it were, in
equipoise between contradictory statements:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As thoughts of things divine ... do set the word</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Against the word.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Faust</i> does not claim to be a universal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Gospel, nor to offer a final solution of the
riddle of existence. It makes no attempt
to pile up Pelions on Ossas&mdash;to scale heaven
with the Babel-towers of the human reason.
It merely holds up a mirror in which we see
reflected certain views of truth, such as
presented themselves to Goethe from some
of his intellectual heights. To regard it
and judge it otherwise&mdash;to analyse its Idea&mdash;to
insist on discovering its Moral&mdash;to
compare it with some little self-contained
system of theory or dogma which we ourselves
may have finally accepted&mdash;and to
condemn Goethe as a prophet of lies because,
viewing truth from such diverse standpoints
(many of them perhaps quite inaccessible for
us) he may seem at times to ignore some
of our pet formul&aelig;&mdash;this, I think, would
convict us of a lamentable lack of wisdom and
humility. And if at times we feel pained by
what may seem irreverent, let us remember
that Goethe wrote also these words: 'With
many people who have God constantly on
their tongues He becomes a phrase, a mere
name uttered without any accompanying
idea. If they were penetrated by God's
greatness, they would rather be dumb and
for very reverence not dare to name Him.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Goethe accepted not without a certain
amount of pride the title given him by some
of his contemporaries&mdash;that of 'the last of
the Heathen.' But which of us will doubt
the sincerity or fail to be touched by the
humility of his words: 'And yet perhaps
I am such a Christian as Christ Himself
would wish me to be.'</p>

<p>There are doubtless but very few (and I
confess that I am not one of these select
few) who can accept Goethe in all his many-sidedness.
We ordinary mortals are incapable
of such Protean versatility and are
sure to find points, often many and important
points, where we are strongly repelled
by his teachings and his personality.
The idealist is scandalized by his vigorous
realism, the realist and materialist by his
idealism, the dogmatist by his free thought,
the free-thinker by his reverence towards
religion, while the scientific expert is apt
to regard him as a mere poet, oblivious or
ignorant of the fact that, although without
scientific training, besides propounding
theories on Colour which were for a time
accepted by leading authorities on that subject
and besides making a discovery which
had escaped the investigations of professional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Anatomists (that of the intermaxillary
bone), Goethe was the discoverer of a law,
that of the metamorphosis of leaves and
flowers, which may be said to have almost
revolutionised the science of Botany.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to our subject and
attempt to trace to its first sources this
strange and suggestive legend of Faust,
the great Magician.</p>

<p>And first, we shall see our way more
clearly if we consider what is really the
nature of that magic, or black art, which
played such an important part in the
medieval imagination.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may say that by 'magic'
was denoted that art by which one was
supposed to gain a knowledge of, and a
power over, the prime elements of Nature
and its cosmic potencies, so as to be able to
combine and use them independently of
natural laws. It is this power that Faust
in Goethe's play longs to attain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>... To find the force</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That binds the world and guides its course,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Its germs and vital powers explore</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And peddle with worthless words no more.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In almost every age and nation we find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
a vital Power, an ordering Force, recognised
as present in the natural world, and the
human mind seems ever prone to believe
such Power to have affinity to human
nature and to be, so to speak, open to a
bargain. The fetish priest, the rain doctor,
the medicine-man, the Hindu yogi, the
Persian Mage, the medieval saint, and countless
miracle-workers in every age, have ever
believed themselves to be, whether by force
of will, or by ecstatic contemplation, or by
potent charms, in communion with the
great Spirit of Nature, or with mighty
cosmic influences&mdash;with Powers of Light
or of Darkness; with Oromasdes or Arimanes,
Brahma or Siva, Jehovah or Baal;
with Zoroastrian Devs, Persian Genii,
guardian angels or attendant demons; with
the Virgin Queen of heaven&mdash;whether as
Selene, Astarte, Hecate, or the Madonna;
with the Prince of the powers of this world&mdash;with
or without his horns and his cloven
foot.</p>

<p>Not only among the heathen&mdash;the orientals
and Egyptians&mdash;but also among the
Chosen People we find the priests attesting
their favour with the Deity, and asserting
the truth of their religion, by what we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
may call orthodox magic. We all remember
how Aaron's rod, in the form of
an orthodox snake, swallowed up the
unorthodox rod-snakes of the Egyptian
sorcerers, and how Elijah attested the
power of the true God by calling down fire
from heaven in his contest with the priests
of the Sun-god Baal. King Solomon too
was for many ages credited with magic
powers and was regarded in medieval
times as the great authority in matters of
wizardry.</p>

<p>Among the Greeks, although mysteries
and witches played no small part in the old
religion and survived long in popular superstition,
magic was thrust into the background
by the poetic and philosophic
Hellenic imagination. The powers of
Nature were incorporated in the grand and
beautiful human forms of the Olympian
gods, or in the dread shapes of the Infernal
deities. But even among those of the
Greeks who were raised far above the
ordinary superstitions of the populace we
find many traces of mysticism and magic,
as for example in connexion with oracles,
with divine healing, with the efficacy of
images and other sacred objects, and especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>in connexion with Orphic and other
Mysteries. And, while for the most part
Greek philosophy was rather imaginative
than mystic, still we encounter the genuine
mystic element in such Greek sages as
Empedocles and Pythagoras, both of whom
assumed the priestly character and seem to
have laid claim to supernatural powers.
Empedocles indeed, it is said, gave himself
out to be a deity exiled from heaven, and
was apparently worshipped as such. According
to a not very trustworthy legend
he threw himself into the crater of Mount
Etna&mdash;perhaps in order thus to solve the
mystery of existence. Pythagoras is said
by some to have met his death at the
hands of the people of Crotona, who set
fire to his house and burnt him alive
with many of his disciples. Goethe evidently
alludes to Pythagoras (as well perhaps
as to John Huss and others who
found their death at the stake) in some
well-known lines, which may be roughly
thus translated:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The few that truth's deep mystery have learned</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And could not keep it in their hearts concealed,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>But to the mob their inner faith revealed,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Have evermore been crucified and burned.</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></div></div>

<p>We now come to Christianity. In the
early ages of the Church the final appeal
seems to have been an appeal to miracles,
and we find the apostles and their followers
claiming the sole right of working miracles
in the name of the one true God and anathematizing
all other wonder-workers as in
league with Satan. We all remember
Elymas the Sorcerer struck blind by St.
Paul, and the adversary of St. Peter, Simon
the Mage, around whom first gathered the
myths which lived so long in the popular
imagination and many of which we shall
meet with in the legend of Dr. Faust.</p>

<p>This Simon, the Magus or Sorcerer, who
bewitched the people of Samaria, and was
looked upon as 'the great power of God,' is
said in the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> to have been
converted by St. Philip and to have
brought upon himself a severe rebuke from
St. Peter for offering to purchase with
money the gift of wonder-working. In
about the third century the legend of
Simon Magus, as related by Clement of
Alexandria, seems to have already incorporated
in a mythical form the discords of
the early Church, and especially the feud
between the Jewish Christians, followers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
St. Peter, and the Gentile proselytes,
followers of St. Paul. Indeed Simon the
Sorcerer was in course of time regarded by
some as having been identical with St.
Paul&mdash;that is to say, it was believed that
St. Paul had been none other but Simon
Magus in disguise. The voice heard at St.
Paul's conversion and the light by which
for a season he was struck blind were alleged
to have been feats of wizardry by which he,
a wolf in sheep's clothing, stole his way into
the true fold in order to introduce discord
and to betray the Church to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>St. Peter, the true Simon, is said to have
followed the false Simon from city to city,
out-rivalling his Satanic miracles by orthodox
miracles, until at length they reached
Rome. Here Simon Magus by his magic
arts succeeded in flying up into the sky in
the presence of the Emperor and his court,
but at the word of Peter the charm was
broken and the wizard fell to earth and was
killed.</p>

<p>But, besides this, the so-called Gnostic
heresy introduced other elements into the
legend. These Gnostics were a sect that
arose in the early times of Christianity.
They pretended to a special insight into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the divine nature, and combined Platonic
and oriental theories with Christian dogmas.
They tried to convert the story of the
Redemption into a cosmological myth, and
regarded the human person of Christ as
a kind of phantom&mdash;a magic apparition.
Some of these Gnostics seem to have
accepted Simon Magus as the 'Power of
God'&mdash;as the Logos, or divine Reason, by
which the world was created (or reduced
from chaos to an ordered Cosmos). From
this a curious myth arose. This Logos, or
creative Power, was identified with the
Sun-god, as the source of life, and as Sun-god
was united to the Moon-goddess,
Selene. Now the words Helen and Selene
are connected in Greek, and Helen of Troy
was accepted by these Gnostics as a
mythical form of the goddess of the moon.
Hence it came that in the Gnostic form of
the Simon Magus legend he was married to
Helen of Troy, and this notion found its
way into the old Faust-legend, and is used
by Goethe in that exceedingly wonderful
and beautiful part of his great poem which
is called the <i>Helena</i>.</p>

<p>After the suppression of Gnostic and
other early heresies came the contest of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
now united and politically powerful Church
against the outer world of heathendom.
While retaining for herself what we may
call a monopoly in orthodox magic the
Church condemned as in league with the
devil <i>all</i> speculation, whether theological or
scientific&mdash;the one as leading to heresy, the
other to sensual ends, such as riches, fame,
and those lusts of the flesh and that pride
of intellect which were fatal to the contemplative
and ascetic ideals of medieval
Christianity.</p>

<p>It was not among Teuton and Celtic
savages but among the learned adherents of
the old Greek philosophy that the Church
in those earlier days found her most dangerous
and obstinate adversaries. Plato and
Aristotle (whose tenets the Christian
Schoolmen afterwards endeavoured to harmonize
with the teaching of the Gospel)
were at first brought forward to oppose the
new religion, these doctrines of Greek
philosophy being largely supplemented by
mystic ideas derived from oriental sources.
It was however Pythagoras, the great
Greek-Italian philosopher of the sixth
century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, the predecessor and to some
extent the inspirer of Socrates and Plato,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
who was most generally accepted as the
rival of St. Paul. It was his mystical
doctrines of Number and Harmony, of the
Unit and the Triad, which were most often
marshalled against the Christian doctrine of
the Unity and Trinity of the Godhead.
Indeed it even seems that Pythagoras was
believed by some of these adversaries of
Christianity to be the incarnation of Deity
(as had been believed in his lifetime) and to
be the friend and saviour of mankind, like
Prometheus of old, who was said to have
given his life for the human race devoted to
destruction by the anger of an offended
God.</p>

<p>No wonder that, embittered by such
opponents, the Church launched her anathema
against all the profane learning of
the day&mdash;all study of the ancient heathen
philosophers and poets. The gods of
Olympus became synonymous with demons
and monsters of the Christian hell, as we
see in Dante and in such old legends as
that of the Hill of Venus. Plato and
Aristotle, and even Homer, were put on
the index. Virgil especially was regarded
as a dangerous wizard&mdash;although in another
age he was honoured almost as a prophet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and a foreteller of the Messiah. I remember
that many years ago, when I was
searching for Virgil's tomb on Posilipo near
Naples, I was informed by a contadino,
of whom I had asked my way, that Virgil
('Marone,' as he called him) was a great
magician. The man knew nothing of
Virgil as poet. Probably Virgil's account
of the descent of Aeneas into the lower
world, and that strange <i>Eclogue</i> of his, the
<i>Pollio</i>, in which possibly a Sibylline
prophecy of the coming of a Messiah is
reproduced, may have credited him with
magic lore, and may also have invested him
for a time with almost the dignity of a
canonical Minor Prophet.</p>

<p>Now, during these ante-Reformation ages
the Roman Church claimed, as I have said,
a monopoly in orthodox magic. She could
send a soul to hell, or by rites and exorcism
she could save the sinner from his compact
with Satan, as one sees in such legends as
those of Merlin, of Tannh&auml;user, of Robert
the Devil, and of that Theophilus who was
converted by flowers sent him from Paradise
by the Virgin-Martyr St. Dorothea. Of
another Theophilus, an eastern monk of
perhaps the sixth century, we are told that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
like Faust, he made a written compact with
the devil, but repented and was saved by the
Virgin Mary, who snatched the fatal document
from the devil's claws and gave it back
to the penitent.</p>

<p>But there is one early example of the
wizard-legend where the magician is saved
from his pact with Satan not so much by the
counter-charms of the Church as by the
purity and steadfastness of Christian maidenhood,
and for this reason I think the poet
Shelley is right in regarding this legend as
'the true germ of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>.' It is the
story of Cyprian and Justina, who were
among the many victims of the persecution of
the Christians by Diocletian, about 300 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
Cyprian was a sorcerer of Antioch whose
diabolical arts failed to overcome the sanctity
of Justina. He confessed himself conquered
and withdrew into the desert as a Christian
hermit. The story has been dramatized by
the Spanish poet Calderon in his <i>Magico
Prodigioso</i>, a part of which has been finely
translated by Shelley. The beautiful picture
of St. Justina by Moretto, where Cyprian is
kneeling before her and a white unicorn, the
symbol of chastity, is crouching in the foreground,
is well known.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>With the Reformation another spirit arose
and legends took a different form. In the
Protestant world the orthodox magic of the
Roman Church lost its saving power and was
regarded as no less diabolic than all other
black art. He was irretrievably lost who
had once given over his soul to magic and
the devil (and the devil was at this time, as
we know, a very real personage&mdash;real enough
to have an inkpot hurled at his head by
Luther). The revival at the Renaissance of
speculation and research, combined as it was
with all kinds of fantastic hopes of discovering
prime matter, the 'Philosopher's stone,'
and elixirs of life, bred in the popular superstition
a mysterious awe and attached to
almost all scientific investigation the epithet
'black,' or diabolic, as opposed to the 'white
art' of holding communion with good spirits.
Alchemy and astrology (words meaning
merely what we call chemistry and astronomy)
became words of hellish import, and
he who practised these arts was in league
with Satan. Thus were regarded such men
as Lully, Roger Bacon, the Abbot Tritheim,
and (perhaps best known of all, at least to all
readers of Browning) Bombastes Paracelsus,
the contemporary of Faust, born at Einsiedeln,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>between Brunnen and the lake of
Z&uuml;rich, in the year 1493.</p>

<p>Thus the sixteenth-century form of our
legend is of the most tragic character. In the
oldest Faust-legend, which first took shape
in this century, there is no hint of his being
saved. And another of its characteristics is its
strong anti-papal tendency. The devil appears
in the guise of a monk, and even as Mahomet
or Antichrist in the guise of the Pope himself.</p>

<p>But the Renaissance (if not the Reformation)
introduced another, entirely new and
most important, element into the legend&mdash;one
which enabled Goethe to use the
sulphurous old myth as the subject for a
great poem. Not only was there a renaissance
of learning, but also of art&mdash;an intense
longing for both Knowledge and Beauty. To
<i>know</i> everything&mdash;to learn the inner secret
of Nature&mdash;to understand, as Faust longed to
understand,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8"><i>The inmost force</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That binds the world and guides its course&mdash;</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>this yearning after perfection by Knowledge
was one of the fruits of the Renaissance.
The other was the yearning to gain perfection
by means of <i>feeling</i>, by the ecstatic contemplation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>of and communion with perfect
Beauty&mdash;'to love infinitely and be loved,' as
Aprile says in Browning's <i>Paracelsus</i>. These
two impulses, the one toward Knowledge
and the other toward Love, were doubtless
awakened by the study of Aristotle, that
'master of those who know,' and of Plato's
doctrine of the soul's love-inspired yearnings
for Truth and Beauty and for communion
with the Perfect and the Eternal.</p>

<p>I have called them <i>two</i> impulses, and
to the mind they must ever appear distinct,
nay sometimes contrary; but I need
not remind you how Christianity teaches us
to reconcile the ancient feud between the
mind and the heart&mdash;between Knowledge
and Love. You may perhaps remember
how Dante, to intimate to us that there can
be no true knowledge without love and no
true love without knowledge, speaks of the
Cherubim and the Seraphim as ideally the
same, and tells us that the Seraphs, who love
most, also know most.</p>

<p>Both these impulses are noble and awaken
our sympathy.</p>

<p>Now, in order that <i>tragic</i> art may have its
effect it must possess what Aristotle calls
<span class='correction' title='pathos'>&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#959;&#963;</span>, so that we may be able to sympathize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with the sufferer. Thus, for instance, Milton
enlists our sympathies even with his Satan,
and it is perhaps because we cannot sympathize
in any way with Dante's Lucifer that
many feel repelled by the terrible creation.
But even in the oldest of the Faust-legends,
and far more of course in Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, we
are attracted by a 'pathetic' element, viz.,
the unsatisfied and insatiable longing of a
human soul for Knowledge&mdash;for Truth&mdash;and
its still intenser yearnings after ideal Beauty.</p>

<p>Thus, even the Faust of the older sixteenth-century
legend, although he ultimately falls
a victim to the devil, has noble and high
impulses by which we feel strongly attracted.
He is lost, not through these impulses, these
yearnings for knowledge, but through his
magic, and his sensual life. In spite of more
than one fit of remorse he is unable to free
himself from the lusts of the flesh; he is
obliged to sign a second bond with Mephisto
and is dragged down ever lower into the
abyss, until the jaws of hell open and swallow
him up&mdash;while the Faust of Goethe's poem
gains strength through many an error and
many a grievous fall, gradually shakes off
the diabolic influence and rising on the stepping-stones
of his dead self is finally rescued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
by God's mercy and reaches the higher
spheres of another life.</p>

<p>How infinitely grander&mdash;how illimitable
in its vistas&mdash;the subject becomes when thus
treated by a great poet we all must feel.
And even if we cannot with a whole heart
accept as a true Gospel what (in spite of
Goethe's admission that God's mercy was a
necessary factor) seems to be a gospel of
<i>self-salvation</i>, we should not forget that this
picture of a man pressing on in his own
strength amidst the lusts of the flesh and the
errors of the mind is perhaps the noblest and
grandest kind of picture that dramatic art
can offer us&mdash;that of the human will in
its struggle against destiny. In any case, I
think, we cannot refuse our sympathy for
these yearnings and searchings for truth
amidst error. Do you remember what
Lessing said about such longings? 'If God'&mdash;he
said&mdash;'should hold Truth itself in His
right hand, and in His left the longing for
Truth, and should say to me <i>Choose!</i> I
would humbly fall down before His left hand
and say: <i>Father, pure Truth is for Thee
alone. Give me the longing for Truth, though
it be attended with never-ending error.</i>'</p>

<p>There seems no doubt that a man named<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Johann Faust, renowned for his learning
and credited with magical powers, actually
did exist&mdash;probably about 1490 to 1540.
(He was therefore a contemporary of Paracelsus,
and also of Luther, Charles V.,
Henry VIII. and Raphael.) Several notices
of this Dr. Johann Faust occur in writers of
the period. One of the most circumstantial
is by the friend and biographer of Melanchthon,
who himself seems to have met Faust.
But the various myths that gathered round
the magician were, it seems, first published
in a continuous narrative in 1587, that is
about fifty years after his death. This is the
old <i>Frankfurter Faustbuch</i>, of which only
one perfect specimen is now known to exist.
It is, I believe, in Leipzig. A mutilated
copy is in the Vienna Library.</p>

<p>One day, when to escape for a time from
the German commentators above mentioned
I had gone out for a walk, I found my way to
the old Wasserkirche&mdash;now the Free Library
of the city of Z&uuml;rich, and here I discovered
a facsimile reprint of this old Frankfurt
Faust-book. As this is the oldest and most
authentic basis of all later forms of the story
and is doubtless the one which (as well as
the puppet-play on the subject) Goethe used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
as the ground-plan for his poem, I perhaps
cannot do better than give a brief abstract
of its contents.</p>

<p>It is written in quaint old German and is
interspersed with many pious comments,
biblical quotations and Latin words and
phrases, and now and then it breaks out
into doggerel verse. The editor (Spiess by
name) tells us that he publishes the book
'as a warning to all Christians and sensible
people to avoid the terrible example of
Doctor Faustus.' He evidently takes the
thing very seriously and has purposely (as
he says) omitted all 'magic formul&aelig;,' lest
'any should by this Historia be incited to
inquisitiveness and imitation.' Johann Faust,
according to this version, was born at Roda,
a village near Weimar. (Other versions say
at Knittlingen in W&uuml;rtemberg.) His parents
were honest God-fearing peasants. His
great abilities induced a rich relation in
Wittenberg to adopt and educate him. He
studied theology at Wittenberg (known to
us all through Hamlet and Luther) and also
at Cracow, outrivalling all competitors and
gaining the title of Doctor of Theology.
But he had not only a 'teachable and quick'
but also a 'foolish, silly, inquisitive' head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and neglecting the Bible became a 'Speculator'
and prided himself more on being an
Astrologus and a Mathematicus than a
Theologus. As the old chronicler expresses
it, he 'took to himself eagle's wings and
desired to search out the reasons of all in
heaven and on earth.'</p>

<p>He now takes to 'Zauberei'&mdash;magic.
Where four roads meet in the Spessart
Wald, a forest near Wittenberg, he inscribes
mystic circles and performs incantations for
the purpose of summoning the devil. After
all kinds of fearful apparitions and noises, by
which Faust is almost terrified to death, a
demon appears in the shape of a 'grey
monk.' Faust invites him to visit him at
his house in Wittenberg. The demon visits
him there and tells him of all the horrors of
hell. But Faust persists in his plan and
makes a second rendezvous with the demon,
who has now procured leave from his lord
and master Lucifer to offer his services and
attendance. The compact is made. The
demon is to serve him for twenty-four years.
Faust is to renounce Christianity and to
hate all Christians, and at the end of twenty-four
years he is to belong to the demon 'to
have power, rule and dominion over his soul,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
body, flesh, blood, and possessions, and that
for all eternity.' This compact has to be
signed with blood. Faust pierces his hand,
and the blood flows out and forms the words
'O homo fuge!'&mdash;'O man, escape!'&mdash;but
Faust, though alarmed, is not deterred. It
is now agreed that the demon shall appear,
whenever summoned, in the form of a
Franciscan monk. He then reveals his name:
Mephistopheles, or, as the old legend gives
it, Meph<i>o</i>stoph<i>i</i>les&mdash;the meaning of which
is probably 'not loving the light'&mdash;<span class='correction' title='m&ecirc; ph&ocirc;s phil&ocirc;n'>&#956;&#x1f74; &#981;&#8182;&#987; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#8182;&#957;</span>&mdash;a
compound which you may rightly
remark must have been concocted by a
rather second-rate Greek scholar.</p>

<p>After a season of dissipation, during which
Faust is supplied with all the luxuries that
he desires&mdash;wine stolen from ducal, electoral,
and episcopal cellars, soft and costly raiment
from the draperies and naperies of N&uuml;rnberg
and Frankfurt and so on (he had, for
instance, only to open his window and call
any bird, goose, turkey, or capon, and it
would at once fly in, ready roasted)&mdash;getting
tired of this kind of thing he falls
in love and wishes to marry. But Mephisto
angrily tells him that marriage is a thing
pleasing to God and against the terms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the compact. You will notice here the
Lutheran and anti-papal tendency&mdash;marriage
being a thing pleasing to God in itself, and
any compact being devilish which forbade it,
as in the case of priests and monks.</p>

<p>Then follow long discussions and disputations
between Faust and Mephisto on the
creation of the world, on hell and heaven,
and on black art and astrology. None of us
may be in a position to question a demon's
accuracy with regard to how affairs stand in
Hades, but Mephisto gives a very unorthodox
account of the creation&mdash;or rather he
denies that there was any creation. Matter
according to his theory (and it is a theory
of some modern scientists and not only of
medieval demons)&mdash;matter is eternal and self-existent&mdash;uncreated,
or self-created, whatever
that may mean. Incited by these
descriptions, and by his 'foolish silly inquisitive
head,' Faust demands that he should
pay a visit to both hell and heaven.</p>

<p>For the journey to Hell the services of
Beelzebub have to be requisitioned. The
devilish worm, as the old writer calls
Beelzebub, places Faust in a chair or
pannier made of bones, hoists the chair
on to his back and plunges (like Empedocles)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>into a volcano. Faust is nearly
stifled to death. He sees all kinds of
griffins and monsters and great multitudes
of spirits tormented in the flames&mdash;among
them emperors, kings and princes. Then
in a deep sleep he is brought home and laid
on his bed. 'This Historia and recount of
what he saw in hell,' says the old chronicler,
'hath Doctor Faustus himself written down
with his own hand, and after his death it
was found lying in a sealed book.' After this
(about ten years of the twenty-four having
already elapsed) he is taken up to heaven
by Mephisto in a chariot drawn by
dragons&mdash;not of course to the Empyrean,
the abode of God, but up as far as the fixed
stars (the eighth sphere). He finds the sun,
which before he had believed to be only as
big as the bottom of a cask, to be far
larger than the earth, and the planets to be
as large as the earth, and the clouds of the
upper sky to be as dense and hard as rocks
of crystal. From these regions the earth
looks as small as the 'yolk in an egg.' He
sees all the kingdoms of the earth&mdash;Europe,
Asia, and Africa (not America, although
America was discovered by Columbus in
1492, about the date of Faust's birth).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>In the sixteenth year Faust wishes to
pay a visit to the chief cities and countries
of the world. Mephisto changes himself
into a horse&mdash;'with wings like a dromedary.'
It is, I believe, not generally supposed
that a dromedary has wings; but I
suppose the old chronicler must have
confused a camel and an ostrich, thinking
of the name which some Greek authors
give to the ostrich, namely <i>stroutho-camelos</i>
or 'sparrow-camel.'</p>

<p>On the back of his sparrow-camel horse
Faust is carried through the air to many
lands and cities and at length reaches
Rome, and visits the Pope, on whom he
and Mephisto (both being invisible) play
various practical jokes, blowing in his face,
snatching his food away at meals and so on,
till the Supreme Pontiff orders all the bells
in Rome to be rung in order to exorcise
the evil spirits by whom he is haunted. At
Constantinople they befool the Sultan with
magic tricks. Mephisto disguises himself in
the official robes of the Pope and persuades
the Sultan that he is Mahomet (another
cut at the Pope, as Antichrist), while
Faust installs himself in the Sultan's
palace and enjoys life and finally floats up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
into the air and disappears. They then visit
Egypt, India, Africa, and other places, including
the Garden of Eden and Britain.</p>

<p>Britain is described (rightly perhaps) as
'very damp&mdash;abounding in water and in
metals....' 'Here also is to be found,' adds
our chronicler, 'the stone of God, which
Doctor Faustus brought thence.' What he
means by the stone of God is, I suppose,
the so-called Philosopher's stone&mdash;used for
the manufacture of money out of any worthless
substance. Faust might have found a
good deal of this stone of God without
leaving Germany and seems to have left a
considerable amount of it behind in Britain.</p>

<p>Part III of the Faust-book relates his
'feats of nigromancy at the courts of
Potentates' and elsewhere, and his 'terrible
end and departure.' At Innsbruck, in the
presence of Charles V. and his court
he summons up the shades of Alexander
the Great and his consort, I suppose
Roxana, the beautiful Bactrian princess.
You may be interested to learn that
Alexander the Great was a 'well-built stout
little man with a thick yellow-red beard,
red cheeks, and eyes like a basilisk,' and
that the old chronicler, quite after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fashion of the modern purveyor for ladies'
journals, informs us that Roxana wore a
dress entirely of blue velvet trimmed with
gold pieces and pearls.</p>

<p>The following chapters strike one as hardly
in the same key with the rest of the book.
They relate feats which remind one rather of
Baron M&uuml;nchhausen. Faust swallows up a
wagon of hay and a team of horses that get
in his way. He makes stag-antlers grow on
the head of a nobleman&mdash;saws off his own
foot to give it as security for a loan
borrowed from a Jew (reminding one of
Shylock and his 'pound of flesh')&mdash;treats
students to wine magically procured (as in
the scene in Auerbach's cellar in Goethe's
poem)&mdash;cuts off people's heads and sends
them to the barber to be shaved, and then
replaces them (a most useful invention)&mdash;makes
flowers appear in vases (like modern
spiritualists or Indian jugglers)&mdash;and lets
flowers and grapes flourish in his garden at
Christmas-time. His most important feat
is summoning up (as he does in Goethe's
poem) the shade of Helen of Troy. You
will wish for a description of Helen&mdash;at
least of her dress. She appeared in a
splendid robe of black-purple ... her hair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of a glorious golden hue, hung down to her
knees&mdash;she had coal-black eyes, a lovely
face, and a round head, her lips red as
cherries, with a little mouth and a neck like
a white swan, cheeks red as a rosebud, and
a tall straight figure.</p>

<p>A fit of remorse now seizes our magician.
He is visited by a pious old man who nearly
persuades him to repent and break his bond
with the devil. But Mephisto is too
cunning for him, and induces him to sign a
new compact with his blood, promising to
procure him Helen. For (as is also the
case in Goethe's poem) Faust himself has
fallen violently in love with the phantom
that he had raised. By the help of
Mephistopheles Helen herself&mdash;or one of
her 'doubles' which play a part in Greek
mythology&mdash;is summoned up, and lives
with Faust as his wife. (At his death she,
and their son, Justus Faust, disappear.)</p>

<p>In the last year he is overwhelmed with
terrible despair, which is deepened by the
mockeries of the demon. On the last
evening he invites his friends to supper
at the village Rimlich, near Wittenberg.
After the supper, he addresses his companions
in a speech of intense and pathetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
remorse, praying that God will save his soul
though his body is forfeit to the devil. He
tells them that at the stroke of twelve the
demon will come to fetch him. He begs
them to go quietly to bed, and not to
be alarmed if they hear a great uproar. At
midnight a mighty wind sweeps over the
house, and a terrible hissing is heard as
of innumerable serpents. Faust's cries for
help gradually die away. They rush into
the supper room and find him torn to pieces&mdash;eyes,
brains, and teeth scattered in all
directions. 'After this,' says our chronicler,
'it was so uncanny in the house that no
man dared live in it. Doctor Faust also
appeared in person to his Famulus (assistant)
Wagner by night, and related to him
many still more weird and mysterious
things.... And thus endeth the whole and
truthful Historia and Magic of Dr. Faust,
from which every Christian man should
take warning, and specially those who are
of a presumptuous, proud, curious and
obstinate mind and head, that they may flee
from all Magic, Incantation, and other
works of the devil. Amen! This I wish
for each and every one from the ground
of my heart. Amen! Amen!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The great popularity of this original
Faust-book led to the publication of many
other versions of the story. In the very next
year a Faust-book in rime appeared. In some
of these versions Mephisto has a very bad
time of it, Faust setting him all kinds of
impossible tasks&mdash;such as writing the name
of Christ or painting a crucifix, or taking him
on Good Friday to Jerusalem&mdash;until the
demon begs for his release, offering to give
back the written compact. In Strassburg at
a shooting competition Faust's magic bullet
strikes Mephisto, who 'yells out again and
again' in pain. In a Dutch version, where
the demon has the name 'Jost,' Faust
amuses himself by throwing a bushel of corn
into a thorn hedge late at night, when poor
'Jost' is tired to death, and bids him pick up
every grain in the same way as in the old
story Venus vents her malice on Psyche.
The most important German version was
that by Widmann&mdash;an amplification of the
old Faust-book. There also appeared a life
of Faust's Famulus (assistant), Christopher
Wagner, whom the devil attends in the
form of an ape. Of one of these versions
(I think Widmann's) there appeared about
1590 an English translation, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
supplemented by various English ballads on
the same subject, and it was an Englishman&mdash;Shakespeare's
great contemporary, the
poet Christopher Marlowe&mdash;who was himself,
as you know, a man of Faust-like
temperament, and not unlike him in his fate&mdash;being
killed in a drunken brawl&mdash;who
first <i>dramatized</i> the story. His brilliant and
lurid play, 'The Tragical History of Dr.
Faustus' follows very closely most of the
details given in the German Faust-books.
Its poetical beauties (and they are many)
are unfortunately, as Hallam rightly remarks,
intermingled with a great deal of coarse
buffoonery. Possibly he had to consult the
taste of his public in introducing such a large
ingredient of this buffoon element&mdash;taken
from what I called the M&uuml;nchhausen portion
of the old legend. Patriotic German commentators
sometimes deny that Goethe knew
Marlowe's play (though he knew Shakespeare
well), but I think there is no doubt
that the opening monologue of Marlowe's
play inspired the more famous, though
scarcely finer, opening scene of Goethe's
drama. 'Theology, adieu!' Faustus exclaims,
taking up a book of magic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>His agony of despair at the last moment
is very finely depicted, and there are not a

expression and thought, are truly Shakespearean.
Some of you possibly know the
magnificent lines addressed to Helen of

<p>Marlowe's play was written about 1590.
Now it is asserted that about this time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
English travelling players visited Germany,
and perhaps introduced there Marlowe's
drama; and possibly <i>this</i> was the beginning
of the German 'puppet-plays' on the subject
of Faust. I do not feel quite sure about it.
Faust puppet-plays seem to have existed
almost simultaneously with the old Faust-books,
and there is even the trace of one
<i>before</i> the oldest Faust-book; at least in the
archives of the University of T&uuml;bingen an
entry has been unearthed in which in 1587
two students were condemned to the 'Karzer,'
or 'Black hole,' for composing a 'Puppenspiel'
on the subject of Dr. Faust.</p>

<p>In these Puppenspiele (puppet-shows) the
comic element largely prevails and is kept
up by the comic figure Kasperle, a buffoon or
'Hanswurst' of the same character as the
Italian Pulcinella, the progenitor of our
English 'Punch.' As might be expected,
these puppet-shows introduced a great many
variations of the story, most of them a
mixture of tragedy and comedy. In one a
raven brings the contract from the devil for
Faust to sign. One of the conditions is that
for twenty-four years Faust is not to <i>wash</i>, or
comb his hair or cut his nails&mdash;like Struwwelpeter.
When Faust attempts to embrace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Helen she turns into a snake&mdash;and when he
is finally carried off by the demon, Kasperle
gives (what Euripides is accused of sometimes
giving) a comic turn to the tragic
catastrophe by cracking jokes.</p>

<p>For about 150 years after Marlowe no
attempt was made by any German writer
to use the subject artistically. Indeed
during this period Germany, devastated by
the Thirty Years War and afterwards by
French literary influence, produced no
literature worthy of mention, and what
writers it possessed were not such as would
be likely to perceive the poetic material
contained in a popular puppet-show.</p>

<p>But the legend had taken firm hold on
the popular imagination and when Goethe
was a boy (he was born in 1749) he saw a
Faust-puppenspiel at Frankfurt, and afterwards
at Strassburg, when he was a young
man of about twenty. He was at this time
evidently also familiar with the old <i>Faustbuch</i>
itself, and it was then (about 1770) that he
seems to have first conceived the idea of the
drama which he sealed up as finished sixty
years later (1831), a few months before his
death.</p>

<p>Goethe's early manhood coincided with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that period in German thought and literature
which is called the 'Sturm und Drang'&mdash;that
is the Storm and Stress&mdash;period.
The subject of Faust, the attraction of
which had for so long lain dormant, appealed
powerfully to the adherents of this
new school, with their gospel of the divine
rights of the human heart and of genius,
with their wild passionate graspings after
omniscience, their Titanic heaven-storming
aspirations after the unattainable and indescribable.
Lessing himself, though never
a genuine Sturm und Drang writer, began
a <i>Faust</i>, and when Goethe began his drama
a new <i>Faust</i>, it is said, was being announced
in almost every quarter of Germany. Someone
(I think it was Bayard Taylor) has
reckoned up <i>twenty-nine Fausts</i> that were
actually published in Germany while Goethe
was working at his. Some one else (I think
Ludwig von Arnim) has said: 'Not enough
<i>Fausts</i> are yet written. Every one should
write one. There is as much room for
them as for straight lines in the circumference
of a circle'&mdash;which, as you know,
is conceived by geometricians to consist of
an infinite number of infinitely small straight
lines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>None of these twenty-nine <i>Fausts</i> are,
as far as I know, of any value or interest
except the unfinished play by Lessing,
which, as it was written while Goethe was
still a lad, and seems to have been only
printed in fragments at some later date,
can hardly come under Bayard Taylor's
list. From these fragments it is clear that
Lessing meant to save Faust's soul, if not
his body. Toward the end of the last
act, when the devils are triumphing over
their apparent victory and the possession of
Faust's body, a voice from heaven is heard:
'Triumph not! Ye have not won the
battle over human nature and human knowledge.
The Deity has not given to man
the noblest impulses in order to bring him
to eternal misery. What you imagine you
possess is only a phantom.'</p>

<p>Although we cannot tell for certain how
Lessing meant to solve the problem, I think
it is almost certain that Faust was to work out
his own salvation amidst error and sin much
as Goethe's Faust does. Before attempting
(as I shall do on other occasions) to give a
description of the two parts of Goethe's
poem&mdash;in attempting which I shall keep as
closely as I can to the original and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
questions arising directly out of Goethe's
own words&mdash;it will be useful and interesting
to consider the most striking points in which
his <i>Faust</i> differs essentially from all its predecessors,
except perhaps Lessing's&mdash;and
Lessing, although he struck the new chord,
did not resolve it. But this is a subject
involving many and far-reaching questions,
which, if they are to be solved at all, are
not to be solved by theory and dogma. I
shall therefore endeavour to state the case
as simply and as objectively as possible,
avoiding metaphysical cobwebs and giving
the <i>ego</i> and <i>non-ego</i> a wide berth. I shall
content myself in most cases with merely
pointing out the doctrine apparently
preached by Goethe (reminding you now
and then that even his own seemingly
categorical dogmas were to him merely
temporary forms of thought) and shall prefer
to let much justify its existence as an
integral part of the living whole rather
than to expel the life by dissection and
to examine the dead parts through the
spectacles of a commentator.</p>

<p>In my next lecture, after a brief consideration
of these preliminary questions,
I shall try to describe the first Part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
drama&mdash;a task of more than common difficulty,
for the story is familiar to many of
you, and a bare rehearsal of the action of
the play would prove wearisome, while any
attempt to communicate by means of translation
the wonderful beauty and force of
Goethe's words is almost bound to prove a
failure.</p>

<p>In my third lecture I shall treat the second
Part of the play, the action of which is far
less generally known. It is not often read
and is seldom seen on the stage. Indeed it
was not written for the stage and does not
lend itself to ordinary dramatic and operatic
purposes, as the first Part does with its
Gretchen episode. It embraces too huge
a circle&mdash;a circle within which lie all the
possibilities of human life. It is a kind of
framework for all the tragedies and comedies
and epics and lyrics ever conceived, or conceivable.
What unity it has is not of the
stage or the dramatic Unities. But nevertheless
on the stage it produces effects
which impress one with the sense of an
imaginative power of an extraordinary kind.</p>

<p>Many years ago, when it was being given
in the Dresden theatre, I saw it performed
four or five times and I remember noticing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the wonderful attraction that it had for
minds of a certain class (and no very limited
class), while for others it was just such an
unintelligible farrago of wearisome 'Zeug'
as Dante's <i>Paradiso</i> and Beethoven's <i>Ninth
Symphony</i> are sometimes said to be.</p>

<p>I believe it is the fashion with certain
critics (especially with those who have read
it superficially) to speak of the Second Part
of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, as they do of <i>Paradise
Regained</i>, with a certain superciliousness,
as a superfluous excrescence, the artistically
almost worthless product of a mind that
had worked itself out and had exhausted
its 'Idea.'</p>

<p>The truth is that the <i>first</i> Part is only
the merest fragment, and although the
subject of Faust is endless and can never
be fully treated in any one work of art (the
whole poem 'necessarily remaining a fragment,'
as Goethe himself said), nevertheless
the <i>second</i> Part does solve in one of many
possible ways the problem left unsolved by
the first half of the poem, namely the final
attainment of peace and happiness by the
human soul, and it is one of the noblest
monuments of the human intellect existing
in the literature of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed it is, I think, still more than this.
It is not merely a monument of intellect
but of poetic imagination, and I am much
inclined to believe that the <i>Paradiso</i> of
Dante and the Second Part of Goethe's
<i>Faust</i> are perhaps two of the best, the
most infallible, touchstones for discovering
whether we really possess what Tennyson
calls the 'poetic heart'&mdash;not a trumpery
&aelig;sthetic imitation but the genuine article.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>GOETHE'S 'FAUST'</h3>

<h3>PART I</h3>


<p>When Goethe wrote to Schiller announcing
his intention of once more taking up his
unfinished <i>Faust</i>, Schiller replied: 'My
head grows dizzy when I think of it. The
subject of Faust appears to supply such an
infinity of material.... I find no circle
large enough to contain it.' Goethe
answered: 'I expect to make my work at
this barbarous composition, this <i>Fratze</i> [<i>i.e.</i>
caricature, as he often called it] less difficult
than you imagine. I shall throw a sop
to exorbitant demands rather than try to
satisfy them. The whole will always remain
a fragment'&mdash;a fragment, perhaps we may
add, in the same sense as even the grandest
Gothic building may be said to be only a
part of the infinitely great ideal Gothic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
structure which will never be seen on earth,
whereas in the Parthenon we have, or rather
the Athenians in the days of Pericles had,
something final and complete, something
which will tolerate no addition.</p>

<p>If Schiller's head grew dizzy at the thought
of a Faust-drama, I fear that one who has
no Schiller head on his shoulders may prove
a poor guide among the precipices and
ravines of Goethe's life-poem, where the
path is often very steep and slippery. But
I will do my best; and perhaps I had better
treat our subject as I proposed. At first I
shall point out a little more distinctly some
of the characteristics which distinguish
Goethe's drama from the earlier versions
of the story. Then I shall try to guide you
steadily and rapidly through the action of
the first Part, offering whatever comment
may seem useful, and now and then perhaps
asking you to step aside from the track in
order to get a peep over some of the aforementioned
precipices.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, one great difference
between Goethe's <i>Faust</i> and many
older versions of the story (including Marlowe's
play, but excluding Lessing's fragment)
is the fact that the sinner is saved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly before his death, in 1832, Goethe
wrote to Wilhelm v. Humboldt: 'Sixty
years ago, when as a young man I first
conceived the idea of my <i>Faust</i>, the whole
plan of it lay clearly before me.' From the
first therefore Goethe had conceived the
second Part as integral to his poem. He
knew that, if he were to write a <i>Faust</i> at
all, Faust must be saved.</p>

<p>We have already arrived at the edge of
one of those precipices of which I spoke&mdash;Faust
must be saved. But what did
Goethe mean, or, to ask a fairer question,
what do we ourselves mean, by being <i>saved</i>?
No formula of words seems able to provide
us with a satisfactory answer. We can
indeed use metaphors drawn from the
universe of Time and Space&mdash;we can speak
of 'another world' and of a 'future life'&mdash;but
as soon as we attempt to conceive
such existence <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i> our
imagination fails: to use the metaphor
of Socrates, we are dazzled by the insupportable
radiance of the eternal and
infinite, and seek to rest our eyes by
turning them toward shadows, reflexions,
images: we accept the beautiful image&mdash;the
enigma (as St. Paul calls it) or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
allegory&mdash;of a heaven in some far interspace
of world and world.</p>

<p>As a poet, and especially as a dramatic
poet, Goethe, if he treated the subject at
all, was compelled to accept some imaginative
conception of a future life, and he
could scarcely accept any other but that
which was in keeping with the old legend&mdash;that
heaven of angels and saints and
penitents which was the converse of the
legendary hell and its fiends. Whether
however he was justified by the principles
of true dramatic art in his attempt to
depict his imaginative conception and to
place on the stage a representation of
heaven may be doubted. Certainly the
effect of Goethe's picture, especially when
seen on the stage, is such that one cannot
but wish some other solution might have
been devised, and one feels as if one understood
better than before why it was that
Shakespeare's dramatic instinct allowed no
such lifting of the veil. You remember
the last words of the dying Hamlet: 'The
rest is silence.'</p>

<p>Thus far therefore we have come: by
Faust being saved it is meant that he escapes
from the fiend and reaches heaven,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
reaches the 'higher spheres' of existence, as
Goethe expresses it.</p>

<p>But the mere fact of his being saved does
not form the essential difference between
this drama and earlier versions of the story.
The point of real importance is that he is
not saved in a downward course by the
intervention of some <i>deus ex machina</i>, some
orthodox counter-charm. His course is not
downward. His yearnings are not for
bodily ease and sensual enjoyment but for
truth&mdash;truth, not to be attained by speculation
or scientific research but by action
and feeling&mdash;by struggling onward through
error and sin, and by gaining purification
and strength from trial and suffering and
resistance to evil; so that evil itself is a
means to his salvation and Mephistopheles
an instrument of good. Rising on the
stepping-stones of his dead self he finds at
last a certain measure of peace and is in the
end reunited to her whose earthly happiness
he had indeed ruined but whose love his
heart has never forgotten. Indeed it is her
love that is allowed to guide him ever
aright and to draw him up to higher
spheres.</p>

<p>When we once realize this we also realize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
how meaningless, or how indescribably less
full of meaning, the poem would be without
its second Part. And yet many, when they
speak of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, mean merely the
first Part&mdash;or perhaps merely the little
episode of Gretchen given in Gounod's
opera.</p>

<p>I spoke of Goethe's gospel of self-salvation.
Since doing so I have recalled to
memory some words of his which may seem
to refute me. In reference to the song of
the angels at the end of the poem he wrote
as follows: 'These verses contain the key
of Faust's salvation: namely, in Faust himself
an ever higher and purer aspiration,
and from above eternal love coming to his
help; and they are in harmony with our
religious conceptions, according to which
we cannot attain to heaven by our own
strength unless it is helped by divine grace.'</p>

<p>It is true that <i>after death</i> Faust's soul is
saved from the demons and is carried up to
heaven by God's angels, but Goethe's drama
is mainly the drama of Faust's earthly life,
and from the 'Prologue in Heaven,' where,
as it seems, the Deity undertakes <i>not</i> to
help him, but leaves him to fight the battle
entirely in his own strength, until the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
moment of his earthly existence there is no
hint whatever, I think, of anything but self-salvation.
On no occasion does he show
the slightest sense of his own helplessness
or of dependence on God's mercy. As for
<i>remorse</i>, Goethe regarded it as a false
emotion and as unworthy of a man.
Although the perfect balance of his mind
and his respect for much that he could not
himself accept saved him from the almost
brutal insouciance of such a form of expression
he would probably have agreed
with Walt Whitman, who tells us that
animals should serve us as an example
because 'they do not lie awake in the dark
and weep for their sins; they do not make
me sick discussing their duty to God.'</p>

<p>Let us however dismiss criticism and turn
to what Goethe as poet has given us&mdash;perhaps
the noblest picture that dramatic
art can give: that of a man striving onward
and upward in his own strength, confronting
(as Goethe says in reference to
Shakespeare's plays) the inexorable course
of the universe with the might of human
will. We might take as the Alpha and
Omega of <i>Faust</i> these two lines from the
poem:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Es irrt der Mensch so lang er strebt,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nur rastlos bet&auml;tigt sich der Mann,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the sense of which is that human nature
must ever err as long as it strives, but that
true manhood is incessant striving.</p>

<p>It is a noble picture&mdash;perhaps the noblest
conceivable. You remember Browning's
lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>One who never turned his back but marched breast forward,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Never doubted clouds would break,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>Sleep to wake.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will have already become evident what
abstruse and insoluble questions present
themselves&mdash;rise, as it were, like ghosts of
many an ancient creed, on every side, as
soon as we have crossed the threshold of
this great Mausoleum of human thought
and imagination. There is the spectre of
the great Mystery of existence&mdash;of Life and
Death and Eternity; and that of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil; and that of Evil
itself&mdash;a phantom assuming at times such a
visible and substantial shape and then dissolving
into thin air as mere negation. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
this Mephistopheles&mdash;are we to regard him
as a self-existent genuine demon of a genuine
Hell, or as our own mind's shadow? Is he
something external, something that we can
avoid, something that we can put to flight
by resisting and get entirely free of&mdash;or has
each one of us signed with the blood of his
human nature a compact with some such
spiritual power, with the demonic element
within him, with that spirit of negation, of
cynicism, of cold unideal utilitarian worldly-wisdom
which mocks at faith and love and
every high and tender impulse&mdash;that part
of our nature which, when some poor
girl is sinking in the abyss, prompts us to
answer our heart's appeal with the sneer of
Mephistopheles: 'She isn't the first!'? Surely
we can well understand the scorn and
contempt which Faust feels for this demon
companion of his. 'What canst thou, poor
devil, give me?' he exclaims&mdash;'Was the
human spirit's aspiration Ever understood
by such as thou!'</p>

<p>The real action of the play begins with
the celebrated monologue of Faust. But
this is preceded by a <i>Dedication</i>, by the
<i>Prelude in the theatre</i>, and by the <i>Prologue in
Heaven</i>, added at various periods of Goethe's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
life. The <i>Prelude</i> consists of a scene between
a poet, a theatrical director and a 'comic
person.' It is merely a clever skit in which
Goethe has a hit at the public and those
who supply it with so-called drama. It has
no organic connexion with the play. The
<i>Prologue in Heaven</i> begins with the songs
of the three Archangels&mdash;sonorous verses of
majestic harmony, like some grand overture
by Bach or Handel. These verses are, I
think, meant to intimate the great harmonious
order and procession of the natural and
moral universe, as Pythagoras intimated
them by his 'Music of the Spheres'&mdash;those
eternal laws against which man, that tiny
microcosm, so vainly strives.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles now enters, as in the Book
of Job Satan is described entering God's
presence, and, just as it happens in the
Bible, the Lord asks him if he knows Faust,
and, as in the case of Job, it is God himself
who not only allows but seems even to
challenge the demon to try his powers,
foretelling his failure although promising no
help to Faust. 'It is left to thee,' says the
Lord to Mephistopheles. 'Draw this aspiring
spirit from his fountain-head and lead him
downward on thy path, if thou canst gain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a hold upon him, and stand ashamed when
thou shalt have to confess that a good man
amidst his dim impulses is well conscious of
the right way.'</p>

<p>That which distinguishes this scene from
the similar scene in <i>Job</i> is its irreverence.
Indeed one might almost call it flippancy,
and few would deny that at times this
flippancy is painful to them. The only
excuse that I can find for it is that, rightly
or wrongly, Goethe meant us to be pained.
I believe that here Mephistopheles represents
especially that element in human nature
which is perhaps the meanest and most
disgusting of all, namely flippant and vulgar
irreverence, and although we may not agree
with John Wesley's definition of man as
'half brute, half devil,' most of us will
probably allow that a certain part of our
nature (that part which Mephistopheles
seems to represent) is capable of an irreverence
and a vulgarity of which the devil
himself might almost be ashamed.</p>

<p>The monologue with which the action of
the play begins strikes at once the new chord
and gives us the leading motive&mdash;one so
entirely different from that of the old legend&mdash;so
indescribably nobler than that which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
is given in the opening monologue of
Marlowe's play. But the old framework is
still there. Faust renounces book-learning
and betakes himself to magic.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I've studied now philosophy,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Jurisprudence and medicine,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And e'en, alas, theology</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From end to end with toil and teen,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And here I stand with all my lore,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Poor fool, no wiser than before.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No dog would live thus any more!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Therefore to magic I have turned,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>If that through spirit-word and power</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Many a secret may be learned</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That I may find the inner force</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Which binds the world and guides its course,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Its germs and vital powers explore</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And peddle with worthless words no more.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Disgusted with the useless quest after that
science which deals only with phenomena
and their material causes, he turns to magic,
as he does in the old legend; but it is here no
diabolic medieval wizardry which shall enable
him to summon the devil, for, as we shall see,
Faust does not summon the devil; Mephistopheles
comes to him uncalled. Goethe has
merely used this motive of magic to intimate
attainment of perfect knowledge of Nature
through the might of genius&mdash;that revelation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the inner secrets of the universe which he
himself, in what he calls the 'Titanic,
heaven-storming' period of his life, believed
to be attainable by human genius in communion
with Nature.</p>

<p>'Nature and Genius' was the watchword
of the followers of Rousseau and the apostles
of the Sturm und Drang gospel&mdash;a return to
and communion with Nature, such as Wordsworth
preached and practised, and such as
Byron also preached but did not practise.
Only to the human spirit in full communion
with the spirit of Nature, of which it is a
part, are revealed her mysteries. All other
means, as Faust tells us, are useless.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Mysterious even in the open day</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nature within her veil withdraws from view.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What to thy spirit she will not display</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cannot be wrenched from her with crowbar or with screw.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Faust turns from his dreary little world of
books and charts and retorts and skeletons.
He opens the window and gazes at the
moon floating in her full glory through the
heaven. His heart is filled with a yearning
to be 'made one with Nature,' and in words
which remind one of certain lines of Wordsworth
he exclaims:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>O might I on some mountain height,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Encircled in thy holy light,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With spirits hover round crags and caves,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O'er the meadows float on the moonlight's waves.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then, turning from Nature, he casts once
more a look around his dreary cell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ah me, this dungeon still I see,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>This drear accurs&egrave;d masonry,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where e'en the welcome daylight strains</i><br /></span>

<p>He takes up the book of the Mystic
astrologer Nostradamus and sees in it the
sign, or cipher, of the universe. As he
gazes a wondrous vision reveals itself: the
mystic lines of the cipher seem to live and
move and to form one living whole; and in
spirit he beholds the Powers of Nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
ascending and descending and reaching to
each other golden vessels filled with the
waters of life and wafting with their wings
blessing and harmony through the universe.</p>

<p>And yet from this vision he turns away
dissatisfied:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>What wondrous vision! yet a vision only!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Where shall I grasp thee, Nature infinite?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And from this cipher of the material universe,
this vision of inconceivable immensity
and infinite diversity, the human spirit which
is not content with the dead bones of science
and has entered into communion with Nature
cannot but turn away dissatisfied&mdash;and even
with despair. Let me try to illustrate this
in a more matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>The human mind discovers, let us say,
that the earth is not the centre of the
universe; that the sun is larger than the
'bottom of a cask,' as in the old legend Faust
discovered it to be; that there are other
worlds quite as large as ours; that this earth
of ours is a good deal smaller than the sun
and actually revolves round it; that even
the sun itself is not the centre of the universe
but one of many suns&mdash;one of the countless
stars in that enormous starry wreath that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
surrounds us, and which we call the Milky
Way. And we direct our telescopes to this
Milky Way and find that what we took for
nebula is for the most part an accumulation
of countless millions of suns, each perhaps
with its planets. Then, as we sweep the
sky with our glass, we discover numberless
little wreath-like spiral cloudlets, and find
that they also are just such wreaths of countless
millions of suns and solar systems, and
that these seemingly tiny wreaths are revolving
round some central body or system,
which itself must revolve round some other,
and that again round another ... until
imagination fails. Is there, we ask, some
final centre of all? some unmoved source of
motion? Or is the material universe infinite?</p>

<p>Then we turn our gaze in another direction
and we find in the tiniest grain of sand
countless millions of molecules whose atoms
(or electrons), it is said, are in perpetual
motion, revolving like the stars. Are then
(we ask) the stars themselves nothing but
molecules? Is the whole material universe
nothing but some grain of sand on the shore
of the ocean of eternity?</p>

<p>We turn away dazzled, and we rest our
eyes, as Socrates was wont to say, on images,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
on reflexions. We try to make the mystery
intelligible, or at least to pacify the reason
by throwing it some such sop as the theory
that 'Size is only relative,' or that 'Space is
only a mode of consciousness' and therefore
nothing real in itself. Or we lull the mind
to sleep with imaginative metaphors and
speak (as Plato did) of the Central Fire of
Hestia, the Hearth and Home of the Universe,
or we call that mysterious unmoved
centre of all motion the Throne of God.
Thus we try to lay the spectre of infinite
Space.</p>

<p>Or consider Time instead of Space. In a
single second how many waves of light
are supposed to enter the eye? About
500 billions I believe. And of these waves
some 500 would not exceed the breadth of
a hair. Now any being to whom these
tiny waves were as slow as the ripples
on a pond are to us would live our human
life of three score years and ten in the
hundredth part of <i>his</i> second, while a being
on one of those great worlds of space revolving
but once in long &aelig;ons around its
centre would live&mdash;if his life were measured
as ours&mdash;millions of our years. Here again,
in our dazzlement, we have recourse to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
metaphor and theory: we lay the spectre of
Time by explaining it away as merely a
'mode' and as therefore of no objective
reality. In other words, dazed and outworn
by the incomprehensible infinities of Time
and Space we console ourselves with the
theory that it is all a mere phenomenon, a
projection of our own mind, and with Faust
we exclaim</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>What wondrous vision! yet a vision only!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and in the words of a still greater master of
magic than Faust himself we despairingly
add that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>like the baseless fabric of this vision,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yea all that it inherit, shall dissolve</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As dreams are made of.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the cipher of the vast material
universe, the Macrocosm, we turn away,
as Faust did, with unsatisfied yearnings.
Whither then shall we turn? Where shall
we grasp Nature&mdash;not the empty vision, but
the warm living form? It is in our own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
heart that we find a refuge from the infinities
of Space and Time&mdash;in that human heart
by which we live, in its tenderness, its joys,
its fears. Here, and here alone, we find
those ultimate facts of existence which need
no explanation, and which we accept just as
they are, without any questionings. Here
we find an infinite universe&mdash;no less infinite
than that of Space and Time&mdash;the universe
of feeling.</p>

<p>From the cipher of the Macrocosm Faust
turns to that of the Earth-spirit, the spirit of
human life and feeling. He is filled with a
sudden, passionate yearning to share in the
joys and the sorrows and the aspirations and
the strivings of humanity:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thou, Spirit of the Earth, art nearer.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I feel my powers loftier, clearer,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I glow, as drunk with new-made wine;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>New strength I feel out in the world to dare,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The woes of earth, the bliss of earth to bear,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To fight my way, though storms around me lash,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nor know dismay amid the shipwreck's crash.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He calls upon this Earth-spirit, the Spirit
of human life. He bends all the might of
his human will to draw him down from his
sphere. 'Come!' he exclaims. 'Thou
must! Thou must!&mdash;e'en should it cost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
my life!' Enveloped in blinding flame the
Spirit of life appears. At the apparition
Faust cowers back terrified and turns his
face away. But it is only for the moment.
Stung by the contemptuous words of the
phantom he answers: 'Shall I yield to <i>thee</i>,
Spectre of flame? 'Tis I, 'tis Faust, thine
equal!' The human Mind claims equality
with the Spirit of earthly life. But the
phantom exclaims: 'Thou art akin to the
spirit that thou comprehendest&mdash;not to me!'&mdash;and
disappears. Faust has yet to learn
a lesson that the mind of man can never
learn of itself, the real nature and meaning
of human life. But he has beheld the
vision of life, he has received the baptism of
fire. Henceforth he is to fight his way
through the storms of life and passion&mdash;to
pass onward and upward and at last to rise
to 'higher spheres'; and amidst the fierce and
insidious assaults of flesh and devil we shall
see that he looks for strength and guidance
to this Spirit that appeared to him in the
blinding vision of living empyreal flame.</p>

<p>Scarcely has the Earth-spirit vanished
when, with a timid knock, there enters
Faust's <i>famulus</i>, or assistant, Wagner. He
has heard Faust's voice and from its excited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
tones has concluded that he is practising
declamation&mdash;reciting perhaps a Greek play.
The poor amiable dryasdust literary and
scientific worm-grubber, whose maxim of
life is <i>Zwar weiss ich viel, doch m&ouml;cht' ich
Alles wissen</i> (I know indeed a good deal,
but I want to know <i>Everything</i>), wishes to
profit from a lesson in elocution. A scene
follows in which the contrast is graphically
depicted between this half lovable, half contemptible
scientific bookworm and Faust's
Titanic heaven-storming aspirations after
absolute truth. When he is once more
left alone, longing to face the mystery of
life but crushed by the contempt of the
Earth-spirit, Faust is seized by despair. He
shrinks from encountering life, with its
delusive joys, its pitiless injustice and its
arbitrary fate. He resolves to seek certainty&mdash;to
solve the riddle of life by death. As
he moves the cup of poison to his lips there
comes floating through the air the chime of
bells and, perhaps from some near chapel,
the hymn of Easter morn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Joy unto mortals! Christ is arisen!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He pauses. Memories of childhood sweep
over him, and he yields to the sweet voices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that call him back from the threshold of the
unseen.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sound on sweet hymns of heaven! As gentle rain</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My tears are falling. Earth hath me again.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Faust escapes the cowardly act of
suicide and gains new strength through the
awakening, for a time at least, of the consciousness,
which had slumbered within him
since the unreasoning days of childhood,
that there is that beyond life which alone
makes life worth having.</p>

<p>The next scene shows us Faust already
in contact with human nature, as represented
by holiday crowds flocking out of
the town into the woods and adjacent
villages at Eastertide. Those who know
Germany well will feel the art with which
Goethe at once transports us into the
midst of a Germanic Feiertag in spring-time,
with its bright sunlight, its throngs
of townspeople streaming into the country&mdash;happy
and merry without vulgar rowdyism;
the smugly dressed apprentice and
the servant-girl in her Sonntagsputz; the
pert student and the demure B&uuml;rgerm&auml;dchen
with her new Easter hat and her voluminous-waisted
Frau Mama; the sedate school-master
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>or shopkeeper, leading his toddling
child; sour-faced officials; grey-locked and
spectacled professors and 'town-fathers'
discussing the world's news or some local
grievance&mdash;all flocking countryward, with
some Waldhaus or Forsthaus Restaurant
as their ultimate goal. And those who
know Frankfurt will recognize the scene
at once: up there above Sachsenhausen,
on the road to the pine-woods and the
J&auml;gerhaus, from which one sees the whole
city lying below one, with its great Dom
and its medieval gates&mdash;the river Main
gliding through its midst and glittering away
westward toward the Rhine; and in the
far background the Taunus range and the
dark Feldberg.</p>

<p>Amidst this scene, externally still the
more than middle-aged German professor
(he must be fifty-seven or so) but with a
heart full of newly wakened yearnings for
human life with all its joys and passions,
Faust wanders, trying to feel sympathy
with all these multitudinous human beings,
attracted perhaps here and there, but evidently
for the most part repelled and discouraged.
He has yet to learn that a love
for and a knowledge of humanity, such as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
finally reaches, must begin with love for
and knowledge of <i>one</i> human heart.</p>

<p>As he and Wagner return toward the
city Faust gives vent to his pent-up feelings&mdash;pours
contempt on his own book-learning
and wasted life and expresses his yearnings
for Nature, and the longing of his spirit for
wings to fly away into the infinite:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>For in each soul is born the rapture</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of yearning upward, and away,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When o'er our heads, lost in the azure,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The lark sends down her thrilling lay,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When over crags and pine-clad highlands</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The poising eagle slowly soars,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And over plains and lakes and islands</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The crane sails by to other shores.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereat Wagner exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I've had myself at times an odd caprice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But never yet such impulses as these.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The woods and fields soon get intensely flat,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And as for flight&mdash;I never longed for that!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Poor dear Wagner, how well one seems to
know thee, with thy purblind spectacled
eyes peering into fusty books and parchments,
or bending over thy crucibles and
retorts! Truly a novel and interesting sight
it would be to see <i>thee</i> assuming wings. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
thy philosophy there is naught but dreams
of elixirs of life or homunculi. Thy highest
aspiration nowadays would be to find the
mechanical equivalent of thought&mdash;to prove
that Shakespeare's and Dante's imagination
was due only to a slightly abnormal movement
of brain-molecules&mdash;to find some
method of measuring faith, hope and charity
in foot-pounds and thine own genius in
electric volts. Thou wouldst live and die,
as other eminent scientists of these latter
days have done, in the certain hope and
faith of demonstrating irrefutably that this
curious phenomenon which we call 'life'
is nothing but the chemical action set
up by the carbonic acid and ammonia
of the protoplasm.</p>

<p>As they walk and talk there appears a
black dog ranging to and fro through a field,
as if on the track of game. Ever nearer and
nearer he circles, and in his wake, as it
appears to Faust, trails a flickering phosphorescent
gleam. But Wagner ridicules
the idea as an optical delusion. <i>He</i> sees
nothing but an ordinary black poodle.
'Call him,' he says, 'and he'll come fawning
on you, or sit up and do his tricks, or jump
into the water after sticks.' The poodle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
follows them&mdash;and makes himself at home
by the stove in Faust's study.</p>

<p>Faust has thus, after his first contact with
the outer world of humanity, returned once
more to his cell&mdash;to the little world of his
own thoughts and feelings. He finds himself
once more amidst his piled-up books, his
crucibles and retorts, his bones and skulls.
He lights his lamp and feels the old familiar
glow of intellectual satisfaction. <i>But the
poodle is there.</i> Faust has brought home
with him something that will now haunt him
to the last moment of his life. There has
been awakened in his nature the germ of that
acorn (to use Goethe's metaphor with regard
to Hamlet) that will soon strike root and
shatter the vase in which it is planted.</p>

<p>At present he is almost unconscious of this
new presence. He is buried in thought, and
his thoughts lead him toward the question
of Revelation. He is drawn to take up a
Bible and turns, with a mind full of metaphysical
curiosity, to the passage 'In the
beginning was the <span class='correction' title='logos'>&#955;&#x1f79;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>&mdash;the Word.' More
than once there comes from the poodle a
growl of disapprobation. Faust threatens to
turn him out, and proceeds with his biblical
criticism.... 'In the beginning was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
<span class='correction' title='logos'>&#955;&#x1f79;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>.' How shall he translate <span class='correction' title='logos'>&#955;&#x1f79;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span>? It
cannot mean merely a 'word.' ... A word
must have meaning, <i>thought</i>&mdash;and thought
is nothing without <i>act</i>.... So this 'Word,'
this 'Logos,' must be translated as Act or
Deed.</p>

<p>These speculations are interrupted by
horrible growlings, barks, and howlings. As
Faust looks towards the poodle he sees it
rapidly swelling up into a monstrous form&mdash;huger
than an elephant or hippopotamus, with
fiery eyes and enormous tusks in its gaping
mouth. He tries to exorcise the phantom
with 'Solomon's key' and other magic
formul&aelig;, and at length, when he threatens it
with the mystic formula of the Trinity, it
dissolves into mist, and out of the mist steps
forth Mephistopheles, dressed as a 'travelling
scholar'&mdash;an itinerant professor, or quack
doctor.</p>

<p>I find that some commentators accuse
Goethe of dramatic inconsistency and of
interrupting the sequence of the action,
because he makes Faust for a time return to
his old speculations, and because Mephistopheles
does not at once appear in the shape
with which we are so familiar&mdash;with his 'red
gold-trimmed dress and mantle of stiff silk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and the cock-feathers in his hat,' the type of
the dissolute man-about-town of the period.
To me it seems very natural that, dispirited
by his first contact with the outer world&mdash;unable
to feel any real sympathy with the
rollicking and sleek self-sufficiency of that
holiday crowd, Faust should turn again to
reflexion and speculation, and that when he
is in this depressed and metaphysical mood
the demonic element in his nature should first
present itself&mdash;and that too in the disguise of
an itinerant professor. For is it not the case
that to many of us the devil <i>has</i> come first
just at such a time and in just such disguise?</p>

<p>Questioned as to his name and personality,
Mephisto defines himself (he too being in a
metaphysical mood) as 'the spirit of negation,'
and as 'a part of that power which
always wills evil and always works good'&mdash;'a
part of that darkness which alone existed
before the creation of light'&mdash;and he expresses
the hope that, as light is dependent for its
existence on the material world, both it and
the world will ere long return to chaos and
darkness. I have already touched upon this
question of Evil as merely negative&mdash;merely
a part of the whole&mdash;and will not detain you
further over it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Mephistopheles now wishes to take his
leave, promising to visit Faust again. 'Visit
me as you like,' says Faust, 'and now&mdash;there is
the window! there's the door! or the chimney
is at your service.' But the devil must go
out by the same way as he has entered, and on
the threshold to keep out evil spirits Faust has
painted a mystic pentagram, a figure with five
points, the outer angle of which, being inaccurately
drawn, had left a gap through which
Mephisto had slipped in; but being once in,
as in a mouse-trap, he cannot get out again.</p>

<p>As Faust now seems inclined to keep him
prisoner, Mephistopheles summons spirits,
who sing Faust to sleep. Then he calls a rat
to gnaw a gap in the pentagram, and escapes.</p>

<p>When, in the next scene, Mephistopheles
again appears, Faust is in a very different
state of mind, and Mephistopheles is also in a
different shape. He is decked out with silken
mantle and with cock-feathers in his hat,
ready for any devilry. Faust is in the depths
of morbid despair and bitterness at the
thought of life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'What from the world have I to gain?&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must renounce! renounce! refrain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Such is the everlasting song</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That fills our ears our whole life long ...</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With horror day by day I wake</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And weeping watch the morning break</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To think that each returning sun</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shall see fulfilled no wish of mine&mdash;not one.'</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He vows he would rather die. 'And yet,'
sarcastically remarks Mephisto, 'some one a
night or two ago did not drink a certain
brown liquid.' Stung by the sarcasm, Faust
breaks out into curses against life, against
love and hope, and faith ... and 'cursed be
patience most of all!'</p>

<p>Here is the devil's opportunity. 'Life is
yours yet, and all its pleasures. Of what's
beyond you nothing know. Give up all this
morbid thinking, these dreams and self-delusions!
Be a man! Enjoy life! Plunge
into pleasures of the senses! I will be
your guide and show you the life worth
living!'</p>

<p>In an ecstasy of embitterment and
despair, though fully conscious that such
a life can never bring him satisfaction
and happiness, Faust exclaims: 'What
wilt <i>thou</i>, poor devil, give me? Was
the human spirit, in its aspirations, ever
understood by such as <i>thou</i>?... And
yet&mdash;hast thou the food that never satiates&mdash;hast
thou red gold&mdash;hast thou love,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
passionate faithless love&mdash;hast thou the
fruits that rot before one plucks them&mdash;hast
thou the fruits of that tree of
sensual pleasure which daily puts forth new
blossoms&mdash;then done! I accept.' 'But if,'
he adds (and, alas, I must give merely the
sense of these noble verses&mdash;for all translation
is so unutterably flat)&mdash;'if I ever lay
myself on the bed of idle self-content, if
ever thou canst fool me with these
phantoms of the senses, if ever I say to the
passing moment, <i>Stay; thou art so fair!</i>&mdash;then
let my life be ended. This wager I
offer thee.' 'Topp!' ('Done!') exclaims
Mephistopheles; and, as you know, the compact
is signed by Faust with his own blood.</p>

<p>You will observe that here there is no
mention, as in the old legend, of any term
of years&mdash;the compact is <i>for life</i>. Of what
may come after this life Faust makes no
mention in his wager. He expressly says
that all he cares about, all he can know, is
<i>this</i> life, and that he will hear nothing about
any future life. This may be agnosticism
or whatever else we like to call it, but it is
not formally selling one's soul, with or
without one's body, for a <i>future</i> life and
for all eternity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover Faust has <i>not</i> summoned the
devil. The devil has come to him&mdash;is
indeed a part of him. He does <i>not</i> league
himself with a hell-fiend for the sake of
worldly power or fame or sensual enjoyment,
of which he speaks with contempt.
He only offers to come forward into the
battle of life and of passions to test the
nobler powers and the deeper beliefs and
the yet dim aspirations of his better nature
against the powers of evil, against what he
calls the 'cold devil's-fist' of negation and
cynicism and disbelief, against the brute
within the man.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thou hearest me! I do not speak of joy&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I dedicate myself to passion&mdash;pleasure&mdash;pain&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Enamour'd hate, and rapture of disdain.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What's highest or what's lowest I will know,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And heap upon my bosom weal and woe.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Footsteps are now heard approaching.
It is one of Faust's scholars. Faust 'has
no heart to meet him'&mdash;and no wonder. He
goes; and Mephistopheles, throwing around
him Faust's professorial mantle and placing
the professorial cap upon his head, awaits
the scholar. The scene which ensues, in
which Mephisto gives the young aspirant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
for knowledge his diabolic advice and his
diabolic views on Science, Logic, Metaphysics,
Medicine and even Theology&mdash;would
offer ample material for a very long
course of lectures; but as it is one which is
not closely connected with the main action
of the play it will have to be omitted.
The scholar retires&mdash;his poor young head
whirling round like a mill-wheel with the
advice he has received and carrying away
his album, in which the devil has inscribed
his favourite text 'Ye shall be as gods,
knowing good and evil.' Then Faust
re-enters, Mephistopheles spreads out his
silken cape, and on it the two fly away
through the air on their adventures&mdash;first
through the small and then the greater
world&mdash;first the world of personal feelings
and passions, then the greater world (is it
really greater?) of art and politics and
Humanity.</p>

<p>Faust had said, as you remember,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>What wilt thou, poor devil, give me?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Was the human spirit, in its aspirations</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ever understood by such as thou?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the leading motive of all that
follows. With ever-deepening disgust and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
contempt Faust, in his quest for truth
through the jungles and quagmires of
human passions, follows his guide. If ever
Faust seems to catch sight of any far-off
vision of eternal truth and beauty&mdash;as he
does at times in his love for Gretchen, and
again in his passion for ideal beauty in
Helen, and once again in that devotion to
the cause of Humanity which finally allows
him to express a satisfaction in life, and
thus causes his life to end&mdash;if ever Faust
shows any sign of real interest or satisfaction,
it is just <i>then</i> that Mephistopheles
displays most clearly his utter inability
to understand the 'human spirit in its
aspirations'; and it is <i>then</i> that he shows
most plainly his own diabolic nature, pouring
out his cynical contempt and gnashing
his teeth at what he deems Faust's
irrational disgust for all those bestialities
that seem to him (Mephistopheles) the
sweetest joys of existence.</p>

<p>His very first attempt is a dead failure.
He has carried Faust off through the air to
Leipzig, and here he brings him into what
to the Mephisto-nature doubtless seems
highly desirable and entertaining company&mdash;to
the 'sing-song' (as I believe it is called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in England) of tippling brawling students.
The scene is Auerbach's Cellar, a well-known
Leipzig 'Kneipe'&mdash;a kind of Wine
taproom or Bodega. Among these brawling
comic-songsters Mephistopheles is in his
element, and he treats them to a comic ditty:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Of old there lived a king,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Who had a great big flea</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As dear as any thing,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Or any son, could be ...</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so on. We need not linger over the
repulsive scene&mdash;so graphically described.</p>

<p>Finally Mephistopheles bores holes in the
table and draws wine from them.</p>

<p>The students come to handicuffs over
it; they spill the wine, and it turns into
flame.</p>

<p>Amidst their drunken uproar Faust and
Mephistopheles disappear.</p>

<p>During the whole of this scene Faust
<i>speaks no single word</i>, except a curt but polite
greeting on entering the Cellar and an appeal
to Mephistopheles to take him away from
this 'scene of swinish bestiality.' How
different from the part that Faust plays in
the old story where he himself, not Mephistopheles,
joins in the revelry and buffoonery!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Auerbach's Cellar existed till lately,
though the house above it had been rebuilt.
It was the original 'Keller' that is mentioned
in the old legend. In it were to be seen two
old pictures (with the date 1525). One
represented Faust sitting at table with
students; in the other he is flying off
through the door astride on a wine cask.</p>

<p>A weird scene now ensues: the Witches'
Kitchen.</p>

<p>Faust had asked how it was possible for
him, the thought-worn grey-haired professor,
to care for, or take part in, what
Mephistopheles looked upon as 'life.'
Mephistopheles therefore takes him to a
witch, from whom he is to receive a magic
draught that will 'strip off some thirty
years from his body,' so that he becomes a
young, man of, say, about twenty-seven.
This scene in the Witches' Kitchen is sometimes
said to represent allegorically a long
course of dissipation through which Mephistopheles
takes Faust, and which of course
could not be represented otherwise without
extending the action of the play beyond all
reasonable limits. It is true that, after the
draught Faust's character seems considerably
changed for the worse. He develops a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
recklessness and a licentiousness which
scandalize even Mephistopheles himself,
who tells him that he is 'almost as bad as a
Frenchman.'</p>

<p>Whether we should understand it thus,
or not, I do not feel quite sure, but anyhow
we have in future&mdash;to the end of the first
Part&mdash;to take into account the fact that,
although loathing all such swinish sensuality
as that of tippling students, and hating
all forms of mean selfishness and cunning
and hypocrisy, Faust is (as so often is the
case with otherwise noble and lovable men)
open to assault at that point where, as
nowhere else, the sensuous and ideal in our
human nature seem to touch and coalesce.</p>

<p>When they enter the Witch is not at
home. In the midst of the kitchen is a
large cauldron, and at its side, skimming
it and seeing that it does not run over is
a Meerkatze&mdash;a kind of female ape. The
Meerkater, or male ape, squats by the fire,
warming himself, and near by are several
young apes. Mephistopheles is enraptured
at the sight of the 'tender pretty beasts,'
but Faust finds them more disgusting than
anything he has ever seen.</p>

<p>The apes perform all kinds of antics and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
chatter a weird medley of half sense, half
nonsense, in which one can dimly discern
satirical allusions to various forms of the
literary, political, and religious cant of
Goethe's generation.</p>

<p>The animals enthrone Mephistopheles in a
chair, give him a feather brush for a sceptre,
and offer him a broken crown, which he is to
glue together with 'sweat and blood.' It is
like some horrid nightmare. We feel as if
we were going mad; and so does Faust himself.
But suddenly he catches sight of a
magic mirror, in which he sees a form of
ravishing beauty&mdash;not that of Gretchen or
Helen, but some form of ideal loveliness. He
stands there entranced.</p>

<p>But at this moment the cauldron boils
over. A great flame shoots up the chimney.
With a scream the witch comes clattering
down, and launches curses at the intruders&mdash;not
recognising the devil in his costume as
modern rou&eacute;. He abuses her roundly and
tells her that his horns, tail and cloven hoof
are gone out of fashion, modern culture
having tabooed them; and he forbids her to
address him as Satan. That name is not up-to-date:
he is now 'der Herr Baron.'</p>

<p>With a hocus-pocus of incantations she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
brews the magic draught, which Faust drinks.
He is then hurried away by Mephistopheles
back into the world of humanity.</p>

<p>We have now come to the story of Margarete
or Gretchen, which by many, perhaps
by most, is looked upon as constituting the
main subject of Goethe's <i>Faust</i>. It is doubtless
the part which attracts one, which appeals
to one's <i>heart</i>, more than any other, and it
forms by itself a pathetic little tragedy. The
story itself is merely the old sad story of
passion, weakness and misery, which has
been told thousands of times in all ages and
all languages.</p>

<p>It would be worse than useless to endeavour
by any dissecting process to discover
how by some act of creative power Goethe
has inspired this little story with such
wondrous vitality that there is probably in
all literature scarcely any character that lives
for us, that seems so real, as Gretchen.
Possibly to feel this one needs a knowledge
of the original poem and an acquaintance
not only with that Germany which is
generally known to the English visitor, but
also with just that class of which Gretchen
is typical, and with just those little ways
and those forms of expression which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
peculiar to that class and to the part of
Germany to which Gretchen belonged.
Every single word that she utters is so absolutely
true to nature that we seem to hear the
voice of some real living Gretchen, and can
hardly believe that she merely exists in our
imagination. This may perhaps be asserted
of other poetic creations; but I confess that
I know no other, not even in Shakespeare,
that produces on me quite the same kind of
illusion. Homer's Nausicaa, the Antigone
and Electra of Sophocles, Rosalind, Miranda,
Imogen, Portia, Cordelia&mdash;all these live for
me, but not quite as Gretchen. Their
presence I feel as something living, but a
little visionary. Gretchen I can see, and
hear and almost touch. I need not recount
at length her story, for it is too well known.
I need only recall to you memories of certain
facts and scenes: that first meeting in the
street; the mysterious presents from the unknown
lover; the meeting in the neighbour's
garden and Gretchen's innocent prattlings
about her home life; Faust's growing passion,
and the vain battlings of his higher nature;
the insidious promptings and cynical ridicule
of his demonic companion; the song of
Gretchen at her spinning-wheel; her loving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
anxiety as to Faust's religious opinions, and
his celebrated confession of faith; the sleeping
draught by which Gretchen causes the
death of her mother; her shame, remorse
and despair; Gretchen kneeling with her
gift of tear-sprent flowers before the Virgin's
image; the return of her brother, the young
soldier, Valentin, and <i>his</i> death&mdash;stabbed by
her lover (or rather by Mephisto) at night
beneath her window, and cursing her as he
dies; the scene in the Cathedral; the pealing
organ and the solemn tones of the Dies Irae
mingling with the terrible words of the
accusing spirit, till Gretchen sinks fainting to
the ground.</p>

<p>And where is Faust? He has fled. The
avengers of blood are on his track. His selfish
passion has been the cause of death to
Gretchen's mother and brother and has
brought ruin on her&mdash;to end in madness,
infanticide and the block.</p>

<p>I have often wondered whether the limitations
of art might not allow the possibility of
some drama on the same lines as <i>Faust</i> in
which he might be saved by the purity and
nobility of womanhood, as in the story of
Cyprian and Justina, instead of, as here,
using the ruin of a poor girl as a stepping-stone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>in his career of self-salvation. Or, what
if he had felt such horror and remorse at her
fate that he had broken his compact and freed
himself from the demon? It will be said,
perhaps, that this would have been undramatic
and that such a view is merely
sentimental and subversive of all true art.
But, once more, what if he had bravely stood
by Gretchen, or had even shared her fate
when she refused to be saved by him?</p>

<p>Anyhow, Goethe did not choose any of
these methods; and if he had done so we
should have had no second Part of <i>Faust</i>&mdash;nor
indeed our next scene, the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>.</p>

<p>Pursued not only by the avengers of blood
but by the avenging furies of his own conscience,
Faust has plunged into a reckless
life and experiences those after-dreams of
intellectual and &aelig;sthetic extravagance which
so often follow such riotous living. This
period&mdash;that of sensual riot and &aelig;sthetic
dalliance&mdash;Goethe has, I think, symbolized
by two wild and curious scenes, the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>
and Oberon's Wedding, a kind
of 'after-dream' of the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>.</p>

<p>The connexion of these scenes with the
main action of the play has puzzled many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
critics, especially the curious Intermezzo
which follows the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>, the
'Golden Wedding of Oberon and Titania,' a
kind of dream-vision, or rather nightmare, in
which besides the fairies of Shakespeare's
fairyland, besides will-o'-the-wisps and
weather-cocks and shooting stars, numerous
authors, philosophers and artists and other
characters appear, including Goethe himself
as the 'Welt-kind.' This scene was not
originally written for <i>Faust</i>, but Goethe
inserted it (I imagine) as an allegorical
picture of over-indulgence in &aelig;stheticism and
intellectualism (the 'opiate of the brain,' as
Tennyson calls it)&mdash;a vice into which one is
apt to be seduced by the hope of deadening
pain of heart. Although not written for the
play, this Intermezzo cannot be said to be
superfluous, for the subject of <i>Faust</i> is one
that admits of almost any imaginative conception
that is descriptive of the experiences
of human nature in its quest of truth.</p>

<p>But let us return to the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>.
On the 1st of May a great festival was held
by the ancient Druids, who on the preceding
night used to perform on the mountains their
terrible sacrifices, setting ablaze huge wickerwork
figures filled with human beings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Hence in later times the superstition arose
that on this night witches ghouls and fiends
held their revels on the Brocken, or Blocksberg,
in the Harz mountains. The name of
Saint Walpurga (an English nun, who came
to Germany in the eighth century) became
associated with this Witches' Sabbath, as the
1st of May was sacred to her. To this midnight
orgy of the <i>Walpurgisnacht</i> Mephistopheles
takes Faust.... They are lighted on
their toilsome ascent of the Blocksberg by a
will-o'-the-wisp. A vast multitude of witches
and goblins are flocking to the summit; the
midnight air resounds with their shrieks and
jabberings; weird lights flash from every
quarter, revealing thronging swarms of
ghoulish shapes and dancing Hexen. The
trees themselves are dancing. The mountains
nod. The crags jut forth long snouts
which snort and blow. Amid the crush and
confusion Faust has to cling fast to his guide.
Once the two get parted, and Mephistopheles
is in anxiety lest he should lose Faust entirely,
the idea being, I suppose, that sometimes
a human being outruns the devil
himself in the orgies of sensuality. At last
they reach the dancers. Mephistopheles is
here in his element and joins in the dances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with eagerness, bandying jokes with the old
hags and flirting with the younger witches.
Nor does Faust seem at all disinclined to
follow suit. He however desists dismayed
when, as he is dancing with a witch of seductive
loveliness, a red mouse jumps out of her
mouth.</p>

<p>At length, when Mephisto, who finds it
getting too hot even for him, comes again
to Faust, he discovers him silently gazing
at a weird sight&mdash;one that might well
have sobered him. 'Look!' says Faust:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'Look! seest thou not in the far distance there,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Standing alone, that child, so pale and fair?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She seems to move so slowly, and with pain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As if her feet were fettered by a chain.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I must confess, I almost seem to trace</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>My poor good Gretchen in her form and face.'</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mephistopheles answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'Let her alone! It's dangerous to look.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It's a mere lifeless ghoul, a spectre-spook.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Such bogeys to encounter is not good;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Their rigid stare freezes one's very blood,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And one is often almost turned to stone.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Medusa's head, methinks, to thee is known!'</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Faust will not be convinced. It <i>is</i>
Gretchen&mdash;his 'poor good Gretchen' as he
calls her. And what is that red bleeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
gash around her neck? What terrible
thought does it suggest!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'How strange that round her lovely neck,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>That narrow band of red is laid</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>No broader than a knife's keen blade!'</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Quite right!' answers Mephistopheles
with a ghastly joke&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'Quite right! I plainly see it's so.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Perseus cut off her head, you know.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>She often carries it beneath her arm.'</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He hurries Faust away. But soon these
terrible presentiments are realized. Faust
learns&mdash;how we are not told&mdash;that Gretchen
is in prison, and condemned to death on the
scaffold; for in her madness&mdash;yes, surely
in madness&mdash;she has drowned her own
child.</p>

<p>Instead of attempting to describe what
follows, I shall offer a literal prose translation
of some parts of the concluding scene, asking
you to supply by your imagination, as best
you may, the power and harmony of Goethe's
wonderful verse.</p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p class='center'><i>A gloomy day. Open country.</i><br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. In misery! In despair! Piteously
wandering day after day o'er the face of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
earth,&mdash;and now imprisoned! That sweet unhappy
being shut up in a dungeon, as a criminal, and
exposed to horrible torments! Has it come to
<i>this</i>!&mdash;to this!... Treacherous, villainous spirit!
and <i>this</i> thou hast concealed from me!... Stand
there, stand, and roll thy devilish eyes in fury!
Imprisoned! In hopeless misery! Delivered over
to evil spirits and the heartless verdict of mankind!... And
<i>thou</i> meantime hast lulled me
with loathsome dissipation ... thou hast hidden
from me her ever-deepening despair, and hast
suffered her to perish helplessly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meph</span>. She isn't the first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Dog! Abominable monster! Turn him,
O Infinite Spirit, turn this reptile back into his dog-shape ... that
he may crawl on his belly before
me ... that I may trample the abandoned wretch
underfoot. Not the first!... Woe! Woe not to be
grasped by any human soul, that <i>more</i> than <i>one</i>
should sink into this abyss of misery&mdash;that the <i>first</i>,
in her writhing agony before the eyes of the All-merciful,
should not have made satisfaction for the
guilt of all others. The misery of this <i>one</i> pierces
with agony my deepest soul&mdash;and <i>thou</i> calmly
grinnest at the fate of thousands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meph</span>. Here we are again, at the end of our wits!&mdash;where
the common sense of you mortals loses its
hold and snaps. Why dost thou make fellowship
with us, if thou canst not carry it through? Wilt
thou fly, and art not secure from dizziness? Did we
thrust ourselves upon thee, or thou thyself upon us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Gnash not thy ravening teeth at me! I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
loathe thee! Mighty, glorious Spirit&mdash;thou who
didst deign to appear to me, and knowest my heart
and soul, why dost thou fetter me to this satellite of
shame, who revels in evil and gluts himself on
destruction?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meph</span>. Hast thou done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Save her, or woe to thee! The most
terrible curse on thee for thousands of years!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meph</span>. I cannot loose the bonds of the avenger&mdash;cannot
undo his bolts. <i>Save her!</i>... Who was
it that ruined her ... I or thou?</p>

<p class='right'>[<span class="smcap">Faust</span> <i>glares wildly round him.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meph</span>. Wilt thou grasp after a thunderbolt?
'Tis well that it was not given to you miserable

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Take me to her! She <i>shall</i> be free!... Take
me to her, I say, and liberate her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meph</span>. I will take thee to her&mdash;and do what
I <i>can</i> do. Listen! Have I all power in heaven
and on earth?&mdash;I will becloud the jailer's senses.
Then do thou get possession of the keys, and lead
her forth with human hand. I will keep watch.&mdash;The
magic steeds will be at hand ... I will carry
you off. So much lies in my power.</p>

<p>'She dreams not' (he says) 'that her loved one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>

straw as it rustles.'</p>

<p class='right'>[<i>He unlocks the prison door and steps in.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span> (<i>crouching into her bed of straw</i>). Woe,

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Hush! hush! I am come to free thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span> (<i>grovelling before him</i>). If thou art a

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Thou wilt awaken the watchmen with

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span> (<i>kneeling</i>). Who has given you, heads-man,

Is to-morrow morning not soon enough? And I am

and that was my ruin. Pity me! What harm

in all my life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Can I endure this misery?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. I am wholly in your power. But let
me first suckle my child. I held it in my bosom all

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span> (<i>kneels beside her</i>). He that loves thee

Evil One is raging there so furiously. Listen, how
he roars and thunders!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Gretchen! Gretchen!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span> (<i>listening</i>). That was the voice of my
friend! Where is he? I heard him call.... Right
through the howling and uproar of hell,
through the horrid laughter of the devils, I
recognized that sweet loving tone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. It is I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. Thou!... O say it once more!
(<i>Clasping him.</i>) It is! it is he! Where is now
all my pain? Where is the anguish of the dungeon
and the chain?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Come! Come with me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. O stay!... I am so happy at thy
side.... What! not one kiss!... Ah, woe,
thy lips are cold. Where is all thy love? Who
has stolen it from me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Come! Follow!... Be courageous,
loved one! Come with me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. Thou art loosening my chain.... Know'st
thou, my friend, <i>whom</i> thou art releasing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Come, come! Night is already on the
wane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. My mother I have killed. I have
drowned my child. Was it not given to thee and
to me? Yes, to thee too.... And thou art really
here! Thou! I can scarce believe it. Give me thy
hand&mdash;thy dear hand! <i>Ah</i>, but it is wet. Wipe
it, wipe it! It looks like blood upon it. O God,
what hast thou done! Put up thy sword, I beg
thee! Put it away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Let the past be past. Thou art killing me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. No&mdash;<i>thou</i> must live!... I will tell
thee about the graves that thou must provide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> to-morrow.
Give mother the best place, and brother
close to her&mdash;and me a little on one side ... only
not too far away. And lay the little one in my
bosom.... No one else shall lie with me. To
cling to thy side, that was once such sweet blissful
joy ... but I seem no longer able ... as if I
had to force myself, and as if thou didst thrust me
back.... And yet it <i>is</i> thou, and thou look'st so
kind and good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. If thou feel'st that it is I, then come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. Out <i>there</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. To freedom!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. I dare not. For me there is no hope
more. What is the use to flee? They are lurking
after me.... It's so wretched to have to beg, and
that too with a bad conscience. It's so wretched to
wander about in strange lands ... and they'll
catch me all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. I shall be with thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. <i>Quick! Quick!</i> Save it! Save my
child!... Onward! Right up that path alongside
the stream ... over the bridge ... there!... into
the wood.... There! to the left! there,
where the plank lies&mdash;in the pond! Catch hold of
it! Catch it! It's rising!... It's struggling!
Save it! save it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. Bethink thyself! One step and thou art
free!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. If only we were over that hill!... There's
mother sitting there on a stone. (Ah!
what was that, like an icy hand, grasping my hair?) ... She
sits and wags with her head&mdash;she does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
beckon or nod to us ... her head droops so heavily.
Yes, she slept so long, and she will wake no more.
She slept that we might have joy. Ah, those were
happy times!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. No entreaty avails&mdash;no words are of use.
I shall have to carry thee away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Seizes hold of her.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. <i>Let me go!</i> I will not suffer violence.
Seize not hold of me so murderously. All <i>else</i> I did
for <i>love</i> of thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Faust</span>. The day is dawning! Dearest! dearest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretchen</span>. <i>Day?</i> Yes&mdash;the day is coming! The
last day is dawning! It was to have been my wedding
day. Woe to my wreath! But what is, must be!
We shall see each other again ... but not at the

<h2>III</h2>

<h3>GOETHE'S 'FAUST'</h3>


<h3>PART II</h3>


<p>The picture which Goethe has given us in
<i>Faust</i> is in its main outlines the picture of
Goethe's own life. The Faust of Part I is
the Goethe of early days&mdash;of the Sturm
und Drang period&mdash;the Goethe of <i>Werther's
Leiden</i>, of <i>G&ouml;tz</i>, of <i>Prometheus</i>, of
Gretchen, Lotte, Annette, Friederike and
Lili; the Faust of the earlier scenes of
Part II is Goethe at the ducal court of
Weimar; the Faust of the <i>Helena</i> is
Goethe in Italy, Goethe at Bologna, standing
in ecstatic veneration before what was
then believed to be Raphael's picture of
St. Agatha, or wandering through the Colosseum
at Rome, or writing his <i>Iphigenie</i> on
the shores of the Lago di Garda; and the
Faust of the last act of all is Goethe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
reconciled to life and finding a certain
measure of peace and happiness in his
home, in the sympathy of his good-natured
but unrefined wife and of others whom he
loved, as well as in his scientific and
philosophical studies&mdash;until he seals up the
<span class="smcap">ms.</span> of his great poem and (to use his
own words) 'regards his life-work as ended
and rests in the contemplation of the past,'
and then, a few months later, passes away
from earth, murmuring as he dies 'More
light!'</p>

<p>It will be remembered that at the end of
Part I Faust is dragged away by Mephistopheles
and leaves poor Gretchen to her
doom. The fatal axe has now fallen.
Gretchen is dead.</p>

<p>In the opening scene of Part II we find
him 'lying on a grassy bank, worn out
and attempting to sleep.' A considerable
time has evidently elapsed&mdash;a time doubtless
of bitter grief and of the fiercest
accusation against his evil counsellor, that
part of his human nature which is represented
by Mephistopheles and from which
even in the last hour of his life (as we shall
see) he confesses it to be impossible wholly
to free himself:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>D&auml;monen, weiss ich, wird man schwerlich los.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Das geistig-strenge Band is nicht zu trennen.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'From demons it is, I know, scarce
possible to free oneself. The spiritual bond
is too strong to break.'</p>

<p>But it is not from grief or self-accusation
that Faust is to gain new inspiration. It is
from the healing power of Nature&mdash;in which
Goethe believed far more than in remorse.</p>

<p>The scene amidst which Faust is now
lying reminds one of some Swiss valley.
The rising sun is pouring a flood of golden
light over the snow-fields of the distant
mountains and down from the edge of an
overhanging precipice is falling a splendid
cataract, such as the Reichenbach or the
Staub-bach, amidst whose spray gradually
forms itself, as the sunshine touches it, an
iridescent bow, brightening and fading, but
hanging there immovable. Through this
scene are flitting elfin forms&mdash;Ariel and his
fays&mdash;singing to the liquid tones of Aeolian
harps and lapping Faust's world-worn
senses in the sweet harmonies of Nature,
tenderly effacing the memories of the past
and inspiring him with new hopes and new
strength to face once more the battle of
life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>He watches the rising sun, but blinded
by excess of light he turns away, unable to
gaze upon the flaming source of life, as erst
he had turned from the apparition of the
Earth-spirit. He seeks to rest his dazzled
eyes in reflected light (a metaphor used, as
you may remember, also by Socrates in the
parable of the Cave)&mdash;in the sun-lit mountain
slopes, the pine-woods and the glittering
walls of rock, and in the colours of the
foam-bow suspended amidst the spray of the
swift down-thundering cataract. In the
ever-changing colours but motionless form
of this bow hanging over the downward
rush of the torrent Faust finds a symbol
of human life suspended with its ever-varying
hues above the stream of time.</p>

<p>It is one of the truest and the most
beautiful of all similitudes, this of pure
sunlight refracted and broken into colours,
symbolizing the One and the Many, the
perfect and the imperfect, the eternal and
the temporal. Doubtless you are already
thinking of Shelley's magnificent lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The One remains, the Many change and pass;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Heaven's light for ever shines, Earth's shadows fly,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Stains the white radiance of eternity.</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Into such variegated scene of reflected
and refracted light Faust is now entering.
He has passed through the 'little world' of
personal feeling&mdash;the world of the One,
of the heart, and he is entering what
Mephistopheles calls the 'greater world'
(for greater it appears to be from the
Mephistophelean standpoint)&mdash;the world of
the 'many,' of politics and ethics and art
and literature and society&mdash;the world whose
highest ideal is success, or, at the best, the
'greatest good of the greatest number' and
the evolution of that terrible ghoul the
so-called Super-man.</p>

<p>It is at the court of a German Kaiser
that Faust first makes trial of this so-called
greater world. The young monarch has
lately returned from Italy, where, as was
once customary, he had been crowned by
the Pope with the iron Lombard crown.
By his extravagances he has already
emptied the imperial coffers. His Chancellor,
his Treasurers, his Paymasters are all
at the verge of despair, and the Empire is
on the brink of bankruptcy. To add to
these misfortunes (perhaps the greatest of
them in the opinion of the young Kaiser)
the court-fool has tumbled downstairs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
has broken his neck; so at least it is
believed; but cats and fools have a way of
falling on their feet, and this fool turns up
again later. Meanwhile however Mephistopheles
presents himself and is accepted as
a <i>locum tenens</i>. To him the Kaiser turns
for advice, and Mephistopheles proposes a
clever expedient&mdash;meant as a satire on
modern systems of finance and State
security. He suggests that, as the land
belongs to the Kaiser, and as in the ground
there are doubtless great quantities of
hidden treasures, buried in olden times, the
Kaiser should, on the security of these
hidden and as yet undiscovered treasures,
issue 'promises to pay'&mdash;in other words
paper money. This is done, and suddenly
the imperial court, in spite of its empty
coffers, finds itself in affluence. The young
Kaiser, delighted at the opportunity of
indulging his taste for display and extravagance,
decides on holding a masquerade,
such as he had lately witnessed at the
Roman Carneval.</p>

<p>The description of this great court
masquerade occupies a considerable space in
Goethe's drama, and is generally looked upon
by the commentators as one of the least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
successful parts of <i>Faust</i>. The question is,
how are we to estimate <i>success</i> in such a
matter? For myself I confess that I
find this masquerade scene tedious and
irksome, and can with difficulty read it
through; but is not this just the effect that
Goethe wished to produce? Is not this
just the effect that society, with all its
masquerades and mummeries, inevitably
produces on any one who, like Faust and
with Faust's ideals and aspirations, is
making trial of life in order to discover
under what conditions it is worth living?
Instead of telling us in so many words that
Faust makes trial of all the pomps and
vanities of fashionable society and finds
them utterly empty and ridiculous, fatal to
all true life and disgusting to all true manliness,
Goethe gives us a picture of this
tiresome foolish scene, with all its absurdities
and falsities and trumpery grandeurs,
amidst which our friend Mephistopheles is so
entirely in his element, and where Faust, with
evident self-contempt and disgust, forces
himself for a moment to play a part. The
various elements of fashionable society&mdash;and,
as a contrast, certain very unfashionable
elements&mdash;are introduced under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
disguise of these masked figures. Marketable
belles and heiresses in the guise of
flower-girls offer their charms and their
fortunes in the form of flowers and fruits to
the highest bidder. The anxious mother is
there with her daughters, hoping that
among so many fools <i>one</i> may be at last
secured. Idlers, parasites, toadies, club-frequenters
and diners-out are there in the
masks of court-fools, and buffoons. The
working man, the trade-unionist and the
striker, comes marching amidst this scene
of revelry, forcing his way through the
ranks of consternated society, roughly
asserting the sole nobility of labour and
demanding the overthrow of the aristocrat
and the capitalist&mdash;no new cry, as you see!
Indeed it is as old as Rome and Athens
and Babylon&mdash;as old, almost, as humanity
itself. Then appear the Graces, symbols of
the refinements and elegancies of life, and
the Fates, symbolizing the powers of Order
and Law, and the Furies, the types of revolution
and war, and a huge elephant, the
incorporation of the unwieldy State or
Public, reminding one of the 'Leviathan'
of the philosopher Hobbes, and
Thersites (that evil-tongued mischief-maker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
described by Homer) representing society-scandal
and calumny. Then comes a
chariot whose charioteer is a beautiful boy,
representing art or poetry. He is the
same Euphorion whom we shall meet later
as the son of Faust and Helen, and
identical with Byron. On the chariot is
enthroned Faust as Plutus the God of
Money, and behind him as groom or
armour-bearer sits Mephisto, an emaciated
hollow-eyed apparition denoting Avarice.
Nymphs, Fauns, Satyrs and Gnomes&mdash;types
of the powers of Nature&mdash;attend the
car and do homage to the God of Money.
The gnomes offer to show their master
Plutus a subterranean treasure-horde of
molten gold. He approaches too close and
his beard catches fire. In a few moments
an immense conflagration spreads through
the crowds of revellers, which would have
ended in a terrible catastrophe (such as
had actually happened at the French court
shortly before Goethe wrote this scene, and
such as happened some fifteen years ago
in Paris at some bazaar) had not Faust with
the help of Mephistopheles extinguished the
flames by the aid of magic.</p>

<p>The young Kaiser now demands from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Faust that he shall give the court a display
of his magic arts. He commands him to
raise the shades of Paris and Helen.
Faust applies to Mephisto, but he professes
himself unable to raise the shades of
classical heroes and heroines. 'This heathen
Greek folk,' he says, 'have their own hell
and their own devils. <i>I</i> have no power
over them. Still&mdash;there <i>is</i> a means.'
He then tells Faust that he will have to
descend to the 'Mothers,' 'die M&uuml;tter,'
mysterious deities (mentioned by Greek
authors) as worshipped in Sicily and
dwelling in the inmost depths of the
universe, at the very heart of Nature,
beyond the conditions of Time and Space.
He who will raise the shade of Helen, or
ideal beauty, must descend first to the
'Mothers'&mdash;must enter the realm of the
spiritual, the unconditioned, the ideal, to
which there is no defined road, and to
which even <i>thought</i> cannot guide him. He
must surrender himself in <i>contemplation</i> and
sink to the very centre of the world of
appearances. Mephistopheles gives Faust a
key, which glows and emits flames as he
grasps it. Holding this key he will sink
down to the realm of the Mothers, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
he will find a glowing tripod (the symbol of
that Triad or Trinity which plays so large a
part in the old Pythagorean philosophy and
in more than one religion). This tripod he
is to touch with the key, and it will rise with
him to the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The imperial court is assembled. A
stage has been erected. The court astrologer
announces the play and Mephistopheles
is installed in the prompter's box.
All is in expectation and excitement.
Then on the stage is seen rising from the
ground the form of Faust attended by the
tripod. He touches the tripod with the
glowing key. A dense mist of incense
arises, and as it clears away is seen&mdash;Paris.
His appearance is greeted by the enthusiastic
comments of the court ladies, young
and old, and criticized by the men courtiers&mdash;with
evident jealousy. Helen then appears,
and the comments and criticisms are reversed,
female jealousy now having its turn.
Faust stands entranced at the loveliness of
Helen. In spite of the angry protests of
Mephistopheles from the prompter's box,
who tells him to keep to his r&ocirc;le and not to
be taken in by a mere phantom of his own
raising. Faust, unable any longer to control
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>himself when Paris attempts to carry
off Helen, rushes forward to rescue her. A
great explosion takes place and all is
darkness. Faust has fallen senseless to the
ground. Mephistopheles picks him up
and carries him away&mdash;with contemptuous
remarks.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the next act we find
Faust lying, still insensible, on his bed in his
old room, where we first met him&mdash;his professor's
study. His daring attempt to grasp
ideal beauty has ended, as it often does end,
and as it ended in Goethe's own case, in
failure of a sudden and explosive nature. He
is now to have an experience of a different
nature. During the years while he has been
making his first trial of the outer world, his
old Famulus, Wagner, now professor in
Faust's place, has been devoting <i>his</i> whole
time and energies to realising that dream of
science&mdash;the chemical production of life.</p>

<p>It is, says Professor Romanes, 'the dream
of modern science that a machine <i>may</i> finally
be constructed so elaborate in its multiple
play of forces that it would begin to show
evidences of consciousness and mind'&mdash;mind
and motion being, according to certain
modern scientists, identical. Curiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
enough a scientist of the same name&mdash;Wagner&mdash;who
lived in the last century, did,
like Faust's Famulus Wagner, in the same
way devote his life to the production of a
living organism&mdash;a 'homunculus'&mdash;in the
conviction, as he asserted, that 'in course of
time chemistry is bound to succeed in producing
organic bodies and in creating a human
being by means of crystallization'&mdash;an assertion
not very different from that of a still more
trustworthy scientist, for Professor Huxley
himself has told us that he lived in 'the hope
and the faith that in course of time we shall
see our way from the constituents of the
protoplasm to its properties,' <i>i.e.</i> from
carbonic acid, water, and ammonia to that
mysterious thing which we call vitality or
life&mdash;from the molecular motion of the brain
to Socratic wisdom, Shakespearean genius,
and Christian faith, hope and charity.</p>

<p>In the background of the stage we see
Faust still lying insensible on his bed.
Mephistopheles comes forward muttering
sarcastic comments on Faust's foolish
infatuation. 'He whom Helen paralyzes,' he
says, 'doesn't come to his wits again so soon.'
He then pulls the bell. The windows rattle
and the walls shake, as with earthquake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Wagner's terrified Famulus appears. He
says that his master, the Herr Professor, has
locked himself up for days and nights together
in his laboratory; that he is engaged
in a most delicate and important operation,
namely that of manufacturing a human
being, and he really cannot be disturbed.
Mephistopheles however sends him back to
demand admittance. Meanwhile he dons
Faust's professorial costume, which he finds
hanging in its old place but infested with
legions of moths, which buzz around him
piping welcome to their old mate. Then he
takes his seat in Faust's professorial chair,
and the same scholar enters to whom as a
timid 'Fuchs,' or freshman, Mephistopheles
had in the first Part of the play given his
diabolic advice as to the choice of a profession.
The scholar is <i>now</i>, after a course of
University education, a match for the devil
himself. He flouts poor Mephisto as a dried-up
old pedant, not up to date with the new
generation's &aelig;sthetic and literary self-conceits,
or with its contempt for its elders&mdash;and
for everything else except its own precious
self. 'Youth and its genius,' he exclaims,
'are the only things of value; as soon as one
is thirty years of age he's just as good as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
dead ... and it would be far better if all
people at thirty were knocked on the head';
and he storms out of the room. Mephistopheles
consoles himself with the fact that the
devil is old enough to have seen a good many
such new generations, with all their absurdities,
their up-to-date fads and follies, pass
away and give place to other forms of still
more up-to-date and self-conceited absurdity.</p>

<p>Mephisto now enters the laboratory,
where Wagner is intently engaged in watching
his chemical compound gradually crystallizing
within a huge glass retort. As he
watches, the outlines of a diminutive human
being&mdash;a mannikin or 'homunculus'&mdash;become
visible and rapidly gain distinct form.
A tiny voice is heard issuing from the glass
retort and addressing Wagner as 'Daddy'
and Mephistopheles as 'Cousin'; and it is to
the presence of this 'Cousin,' we may infer,
rather than to his scientific 'Daddy' that the
Homunculus really owes his existence. With
the connivance of Mephistopheles, the Mannikin,
still in his glass retort, slips from the
enamoured paternal grasp of Wagner, and
floats through the air into the adjacent room,
hovering above Faust, who is still asleep on
his couch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>As it hovers above the sleeper it begins to
sing&mdash;to describe ravishing dreamland scenery&mdash;inspiring
Faust with visions of sensuous
loveliness. It then bids Mephistopheles
wrap Faust in his magic mantle and prepare
for an aerial flight.... 'Whither?' asks
Mephistopheles. '<i>To Greece!</i>' is the
answer: to the Pharsalian plain in Thessaly;
and in spite of the protests of Mephistopheles
(who has no taste for the land of classic art)
he is forced to obey. The sleeping form of
Faust is borne aloft, the Mannikin leading
the way like a will-o'-the-wisp, gleaming
within his glass retort. '<i>Und ich?</i>' exclaims
poor old Wagner in piteous accents. '<i>Ach,
du!</i>' says Homunculus, '<i>Du bleibst zu
Hause&mdash;!</i>' 'You just stop at home, and grub
away among your musty manuscripts, and
work away at your protoplasms and your
elixirs of life.' Thus, guided by the Homunculus,
Faust and Mephistopheles set forth on
their aerial journey to ancient Greece&mdash;to
the land where the ideals of art have found
their highest realization&mdash;in quest of Helen,
the supreme type of all that the human mind
has conceived as beautiful.</p>

<p>It is often asked, and I think <i>we</i> may
fairly ask, what Goethe meant to symbolize<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
by his Homunculus. You will have noticed
that his material components (as the carbonic
acid and ammonia of Professor
Huxley's protoplasm) are supplied by his
scientific 'Daddy,' but that the 'tertia vis,'
that third power or 'spiritual bond' which
combines his material components, is supplied
by the supernatural presence of
Mephistopheles. I believe this Homunculus
to be a symbol of poetic genius or
imagination, which uses the material supplied
by plodding pedantry&mdash;by critical
research, antiquarianism, scholarship, and
science&mdash;slips from the hands of its poor
enamoured Daddy, and flies off to the land
of idealism. Here, as we shall see, the
Mannikin breaks free from his glass retort
and is poured out like phosphorescent light
on the waves of the great ocean.</p>

<p>But the quest for Helen, for ideal beauty,
leads through scenes haunted by forms of
weird and terrible nature&mdash;those forms in
which the human imagination, as it gradually
gains a sense of the supernatural and a sense
of art, first incorporated its conceptions&mdash;forms,
first, of hideous and terrific character:
monstrous idols of Eastern and Egyptian
superstition, Griffins, and Sphinxes, and bull-headed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>Molochs, and horned Astartes, and
many-breasted Cybeles, till in the Hellenic
race it rose to the recognition of the beautiful
and bodied forth divinity in the human form
divine, and found its highest ideal of beauty
in Helen, divinely fair of women. This
phase in Faust's development&mdash;this stage in
his quest for beauty and truth&mdash;this delirium
of his 'divine madness,' as Plato calls our
ecstasy of yearning after ideal beauty, is
symbolized by the classical <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>.
(You remember the other <i>Walpurgisnacht</i>&mdash;that
on the Blocksberg&mdash;which I described
before.)</p>

<p>Guided by the Mannikin, Faust and
Mephistopheles arrive at the Pharsalian
fields&mdash;the great plain of Thessaly, renowned
for the battle of Pharsalus, in
which Caesar conquered Pompey&mdash;renowned
too as the classic ground of witches and
wizards. Griffins, Sphinxes and Sirens meet
them. They can tell Faust nothing about
Helen, but they direct him to Cheiron the
Centaur (a link, as it were, between the
monstrous forms of barbarous oriental
imagination and Hellenic art). Cheiron the
Centaur has himself borne Helen on his
back, and excites Faust's passion by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
description of her beauty. He takes Faust
to the prophetess Manto, daughter of the
old blind Theban prophet Teiresias, and she
conducts him to a dark fissure&mdash;a Bocca
dell' Inferno&mdash;at the foot of Mount Olympus,
such as that which you may have seen in
the Sibyl's cave on Lake Avernus; and
here (as once Orpheus did in search of
Eurydice) he descends to the realms of the
dead to seek the help of Persephone, Queen
of Hades, in his quest for Helen. Meanwhile
Mephisto has found that in spite of
his distaste for classic art and beauty there
are elements in the classical witches' sabbath
not less congenial to him than those of the
Blocksberg with its northern and more
modern types of devilry and bestiality.
He is enchanted with the ghoulish vampire
Empusa and the monster Lamia, half-snake
half-woman, and at length finds <i>his</i> ideal
of beauty in the loathsome and terrible
Phorkyads, daughters of Phorkys, an old
god of the sea. The Phorkyads are sometimes
described as identical with, sometimes
as sisters of, the Gorgons, and represent the
climax of all that Greek imagination has
created of the horrible. The three sisters
are pictured in Greek mythology as possessing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>between them only one eye and one
tooth, which they pass round for use. They
dwelt in outer darkness, being too terrible
for sun or moon to look upon. Even
Mephistopheles is at first a little staggered
by the sight, but he soon finds himself on
familiar terms with them and ends by
borrowing the form of one of them (she
becoming for the time absorbed into her
two sisters)&mdash;for as medieval devil he has no
right of entr&eacute;e into that classical scene in
which he and Faust are now to play their
parts. It is therefore in the form of a
Phorkyad or Gorgon that Mephisto will
appear when we next meet him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Homunculus has found
congenial spirits among the sea-nymphs and
sirens on the shores of the Aegean. He
longs to gain freedom from his glass, in
which he is still imprisoned. Nereus the
sea-god is unable to help him, but sends
him to his father Proteus, the great ocean
prophet, who bears him out into the midst
of the ocean. Here Galatea the sea-goddess
(identical with Aphrodite, the sea-born
symbol of the beauty of the natural-world)
passes by in her chariot drawn by dolphins
and surrounded by Nereids. The Homunculus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>in an ecstasy of love dashes himself
against her chariot. The glass is shattered
and he is poured forth in a stream of phosphorescent
light over the waves&mdash;thus being
once more made one with Nature.</p>

<p>The theory that <i>water</i> was the prime
element, a theory advocated especially by
the old Ionic philosopher Thales, was held
by Goethe, who was a 'sedimentarist' in
geological matters, and in this classical
<i>Walpurgisnacht</i> he has introduced, much to
the annoyance of many critics, a dispute
between Thales and other sages on the
question whether the formation of the world
was due to fire or water.</p>

<p>We have now reached that part of <i>Faust</i>
which is known as the <i>Helena</i>. It was
written before the rest of Part II, though
doubtless when he wrote it Goethe had
already conceived the general outline of the
whole poem. Of the wonderful versatility
of Goethe's genius no more striking example
can be given than the sudden and
complete change of scene, and not only
scene but ideas and feelings, by which
we are transported from the age of Luther
and the court of a German Kaiser and
the laboratory of a modern scientist back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&mdash;some
3500 years or so&mdash;to the age of
the Trojan war.</p>

<p>Instead of extravagance and grotesqueness,
instead of the diversity, the rich
ornamentation, the heaven-soaring pinnacles
and spires of Gothic imagination&mdash;we
have in the <i>Helena</i> sculpturesque
repose, simplicity, dignity and proportion.
It is as if we had been suddenly transported
from some Gothic cathedral to the
Parthenon, or to Paestum.</p>

<p>I know no poet who in any modern
language has reproduced as Goethe has
done in his <i>Iphigenie</i> and in the <i>Helena</i>
not only the external form but also the
spirit of Hellenic literature. While reading
the <i>Helena</i> we feel ourselves under the
cloudless Grecian sky; we breathe the
Grecian air with Helen herself.</p>

<p>The scene is laid before the palace of
Menelaus at Sparta. Helen, accompanied
by a band of captive Trojan maidens, has
been disembarked at the mouth of the river
Eurotas by Menelaus, on his return from
Troy, and has been sent forward to Sparta
to make preparation for the arrival of her
husband and his warriors. Once more after
those long eventful years since she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
fled to Troy with Paris she stands as in a
dream before her own palace-home, dazed
and wearied, her mind distraught with
anxious thoughts; for during the long
wearisome return across the Aegean sea her
husband Menelaus has addressed no friendly
word to her, but seemed gloomily revolving
in his heart some deed of vengeance. She
knows not if she is returning as queen, or as
captive, doomed perhaps to the fate of a
slave.</p>

<p>She enters the palace alone. After a few
moments she reappears, horror-struck and
scarce able to tell what she has seen.
Crouching beside the central hearth she has
found a terrible shape&mdash;a ghastly haggard
thing, like some phantom of hell. It has
followed her. It stands there before her on
the threshold of her palace. In terrible
accents this Gorgon-like monster denounces
her, recounting all the ruin that by her fatal
beauty she had wrought, interweaving into
the story the various legends connected with
her past life&mdash;those mysterious legends that
connect Helen not only with Paris and
Menelaus but with Theseus and Achilles
and with Egypt&mdash;legends of a second
phantom-Helen, the 'double' of that Helen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
whom Menelaus has carried home from
Troy&mdash;until alarmed and distracted, doubting
her own identity, overwhelmed by
anxiety about the future and by terror at
the grisly apparition, she seems herself to be
in truth fading away into a mere phantom,
and sinks senseless to the ground. After a
fierce altercation between the chorus of
captive maidens and the Gorgon-shape (in
whom you will have recognized our old
friend Mephistopheles) Helen returns to
consciousness. Then the Phorkyad-Mephistopheles
tells her that the preparations
which she has been ordered to make are in
view of a sacrifice to be performed on the
arrival of Menelaus and that she herself
(Helen) is the destined victim.</p>

<p>In despair Helen appeals to the Gorgon
for advice, who bids her take refuge in the
neighbouring mountains of Arcadia, where
a robber chieftain has his stronghold. Under
the guidance of Mephisto, who raises a thick
mist, she and her maidens escape. They
climb the mountain; the mists rise and
they find themselves before the castle of a
medieval bandit-prince, and it is Faust
himself who comes forth to greet her and to
welcome her as his queen and mistress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Faust, the symbol of the Renaissance and
modern art, welcomes to his castle the ideal
of Greek art and beauty.</p>

<p>The stately Greek measures now give way
to the love-songs of Chivalry and Romance&mdash;to
the measures of the Minnesinger and the
Troubadour. Faust kneels in homage before
the impersonation of ideal beauty, and Helen
feels that she is <i>now</i> no longer a mere ideal,
a mere phantom. She clings to her new,
unknown lover, as to one who will make her
realize her own existence. It is an allegory
of modern art&mdash;the art of Dante, Giotto,
Raphael, Shakespeare and Goethe&mdash;receiving
as its queen the ideal of Greek imagination
and inspiring, as it were, the cold statue
with the warm vitality of a higher conception
of chivalrous love and perfect womanhood.</p>

<p>I have mentioned how the stately Greek
measures in the <i>Helena</i> give way to the
metres of Romance and Chivalry. Perhaps
it may be well to explain some of these
various metres.</p>

<p>The scene opens, as you know, with
Helen's dignified and beautiful speech:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Bewundert viel und viel gescholten Helena.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is the well-known <i>iambic trimeter</i>, <i>i.e.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the metre of six feet (twelve syllables) used
in all the speeches in Greek tragedy.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Oedipus Tyrannos</i> of Sophocles
begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class='correction' title='O tekna, Kadmou tou palai nea troph&ecirc;'>&#x1f6e; &#964;&#8051;&#954;&#957;&#945;&#885; &#922;&#945;&#948;&#956;&#959;&#965; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#8049;&#955;&#945;&#953; &#957;&#941;&#945; &#964;&#961;&#959;&#981;&#8052;</span><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so on. It has twelve syllables, mostly
(iambics) as in our blank verse. But blank
verse has only ten syllables: 'I cannot tell
what you and other men.' If one adds two
syllables one gets the Greek iambic verse,
thus: 'I cannot tell what you and other
men believe.' The Chorus in the <i>Helena</i>
uses various rhythms such as are found in
the choruses of Greek tragedy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>Schweige, schweige,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Missblickende, missredende du!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aus so gr&auml;sslichen, einzahnigen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Lippen was enthaucht wohl</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Solchem furchtbaren Greuelschlund!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Mephistopheles, as the Phorkyad, when
Helen falls fainting, addresses her suddenly
in another measure&mdash;a longer verse, such as
is sometimes used by the Greek tragedians
and comedians when something new occurs
in the play. It is called a <i>tetrameter</i>, and
consists of fifteen syllables (mostly &mdash;&#8746;, called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
trochees). Thus, in Greek, <span class='correction' title='oi gerontes oi palaioi memphomestha t&ecirc; polei'>&#959;&#7985; &#947;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;
&#959;&#7985; &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#8054; &#956;&#949;&#956;&#934;&#8004;&#956;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945; &#964;&#8135; &#960;&#972;&#955;&#949;&#953;</span>&mdash;and in German:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tritt hervor aus fl&uuml;chtigen Wolken hohe Sonne dieses Tags&mdash;</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or the fine lines spoken by Helen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Doch es ziemet K&ouml;niginnen, allen Menschen ziemt es wohl,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sich zu fassen, zu ermannen, was auch drohend &uuml;berrascht.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Faust appears he begins to speak
at once in modern blank verse of ten
syllables, such as we know in Milton and
Shakespeare and Schiller. One might have
expected him to speak in some earlier
romantic measure, to have used perhaps the
metre of the old Nibelungenlied, as in</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Es ist in alten M&auml;hren wunders viel geseit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Von Heleden lobeb&auml;ren, von grosser Arebeit,</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which is supposed to date from about 1150;
or in Dante's <i>terza rima</i>, of about 1300, as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But blank verse is after all the metre <i>par
excellence</i> of the Renaissance, that is of the
revival of Greek influence, and Goethe
chose it for this reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the Watchman Lynceus ('the keen-eyed,'
as the word means&mdash;and you perhaps
remember him as the watchman of the
Argonauts on the good ship Argo) represents
here the early pre-Renaissance poets
of Italy and Provence and Germany&mdash;the
Troubadours and Trouv&egrave;res and Minnesinger,
who were so surprised and dazzled
by the sudden sunrise of the Renaissance
with its wonderful new apparition of Greek
art that they (as Lynceus in <i>Faust</i>) failed
to announce its coming; and therefore
Lynceus here speaks in a kind of early
Troubadour metre, with <i>rime</i>. In classical
poetry there is no rime. They did not like
it; they even ridiculed it. For instance
Cicero, the great orator, once tried to write
poetry, and produced a line that said
'O fortunate Rome, when I was consul!'
This was not only conceited of him but
unfortunately the line contained a rime and
this rime brought down an avalanche of
ridicule on his head. 'O fortunatam natam
me consule Romam' was this unfortunate
line. Rime was probably first adopted by
the monks in their medieval Latin hymns
and was used by the Troubadours and early
Italian poets when they began to write i<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>n
the vulgar tongue. Dante uses it in his
canzoni and sonnets and ballads, as well of
course as in his great poem. So it is quite
right to make Lynceus speak in rime.
Helen of course has never heard rime
before, and she turns to Faust and asks
him what it is that sounds so strange and
beautiful in this song of Lynceus; and she
wants to know how <i>she</i> too can learn the art.
So Faust tells her just to try and the rimes
will come of their own accord. But I will
quote the passage, for it is very pretty; and
I will add a rough translation.</p>

</div>

<p>In the midst of this life of chivalrous love
and romance Faust and Helen pass a period
of ecstatic bliss. But, as Goethe himself
found, such ecstasies are only a passing phase.
The end comes inevitably and suddenly.
A son is born to them, Euphorion by name
(the name of the winged son of Helen and
Achilles, according to one legend). He is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
no common human child. As a butterfly
from its chrysalis he bursts at once into
fully developed existence. He is of enchanting
beauty but wild and capricious; spurning
the common earth he climbs ever higher
and higher amidst the mountain crags, singing
ravishing melodies to his lyre. He
reaches the topmost crag and casts himself
into the air. A flame flickers upwards, and
the body of a beautiful youth 'in which one
seems to recognize a well-known form' falls
to the ground, at the feet of Faust and
Helen.</p>

<p>Euphorion symbolizes modern poetry,
and the well-known form is that of Byron.
For a moment the body lies there; it then
dissolves in flame, which ascends to heaven,
and a voice is heard calling on Helen to
follow.</p>

<p>Yes, she must follow. As flame she
must return to her home in the Empyrean&mdash;the
home of ideal beauty and all other
ideals. However much we strive to realize
ideal beauty in art or in our lives, however
we may hold it to our hearts as a warm
and living possession, it always escapes our
grasp. The short-lived winged child of
poetic inspiration gleams but for a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and disappears, as a flame flickering back
to its native empyrean. And she, the
mother, she too must follow, leaving us
alone to face the stern reality of life and of
death.</p>

<p>In the embrace of Faust Helen melts
away into thin air, leaving in his arms her
robe and veil. These change into a cloud,
which envelops him, raises him into the air
and bears him also away. The Phorkyad
picks up Euphorion's lyre and mantle; he
steps forward and addresses the audience,
assuring them that in the leavings of poetic
genius he has got enough to fit out any
number of modern poets, and is open to a
bargain. He then swells up to a gigantic
height, removes the Gorgon-mask, and
reveals himself as Mephistopheles once
more the northern modern devil; and the
curtain falls.</p>

<p>When it rises for the Fourth Act we see
a craggy mountain peak before us. A cloud
approaches, and deposits Faust on the topmost
crag. It lingers for a time, assuming
wondrous shapes and then gradually melts
away into the blue. Faust gazes at it. In
its changing outlines he seems to discern
first the regal forms of Olympian goddesses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of Juno, of Leda&mdash;then of Helen. But
they fade away and, ere it disappears, the
cloud assumes the likeness of that other
half-forgotten human form which once had
aroused in his heart that which he now feels
to have been a love far truer and deeper than
all his passion for ideal beauty&mdash;that 'swiftly
felt and scarcely comprehended' love for a
human heart which, as he now confesses to
himself, 'had it been retained would have
been his most precious possession.'</p>

<p>A seven-league boot now passes by&mdash;followed
in hot haste by another. Out of the
boots steps forth Mephistopheles. He asks
contemptuously if Faust has had enough of
heroines and all such ideal folly. He cannot
understand why Faust is still dissatisfied
with life. Surely he has seen enough of its
pleasures. He advises him, if he is weary
of court life, to build himself a Sultan's
palace and harem and live in retirement&mdash;as
Tiberius did on the island of Capri.
'Not so,' answers Faust. 'This world of
earthly soil Still gives me room for greater
action. I feel new strength for nobler
toil&mdash;Toil that at length shall bring me
satisfaction.'</p>

<p>He has determined to devote the rest of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
life to humanity, to the good of the human
race. It is a project with which Mephistopheles
naturally has little sympathy. But
he is forced to acquiesce, and, being bound
to serve Faust even in this, he suggests a
plan. The young Kaiser is at present in
great difficulties. He is hard pressed by a
rival Emperor&mdash;a pretender to the Imperial
crown. Mephisto will by his magic arts
secure the Kaiser the victory over this
pretender, and then Faust will claim as
recompense a tract of country bordering on
the ocean. Here by means of canals and
dykes, dug and built by demonic powers,
Faust is to reclaim from the sea a large
region of fertile country and to found a
kind of model republic, where peace and
prosperity and every social and political
blessing shall find a home. The plan is
carried out. At the summons of Mephistopheles
appear three gigantic warriors by
whose help the battle is won, and Faust
gains his reward&mdash;the stretch of land on
the shore of the ocean. And he is not the
only gainer. The Archbishop takes the
opportunity of extracting far more valuable
concessions of land from the young Kaiser
as penance for his having associated himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with powers of darkness. The prelate even
extracts the promise of tithes and dues from
all the land still unclaimed by Faust. As
Mephistopheles aptly remarks, the Church
seems to have a good digestion.</p>

<p>Many years are now supposed to elapse.
Faust has nearly completed his task of
expelling the sea and founding his ideal
state. What had been a watery waste is
now like the garden of Eden in its luxuriant
fertility. Thousands of industrious happy
mortals have found in this new country
a refuge and a home. Ships, laden with
costly wares, throng the ports. On an
eminence overlooking the scene stands the
castle of Faust, and not far off are a cottage
and a chapel. On this scene the last act
opens. A wanderer enters. He is seeking
the cottage which once used to stand here,
on the very brink of the ocean. It was here
that he was shipwrecked: here, on this very
spot, the waves had cast him ashore: here
stands still the cottage of the poor old
peasant and his wife who had rescued him
from death. But now the sea is sparkling
in the blue distance and beneath him
spreads the new country with its waving
cornfields. He enters the cottage and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
welcomed by the poor old couple (to whom
Goethe has given the names Philemon and
Baucis, the old peasant and his wife who,
according to the Greek legend, were the
only Phrygians who offered hospitality to
Zeus, the King of the Gods, as he was
wandering about in disguise among mortals).</p>

<p>Faust comes out on to the garden terrace
of his castle. He is now an old man&mdash;close
upon a hundred years of age. He gazes
with a feeling of happiness and satisfaction
at the scene that lies below him&mdash;the wide
expanse of fertile land, the harbours and
canals filled with shipping. Suddenly the
bell in the little chapel begins to ring for
Vespers.</p>

<p>Faust's happiness is in a moment changed
into bitterness and anger. This cottage,
this chapel, this little plot of land are as
thorns in his side: they are the Naboth's
vineyard which he covets and which alone
interferes with his territorial rights. He
has offered large sums of money, but the
peasant will not give up his home.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles and his helpers (the same
three gigantic supernatural beings who took
part in the battle) appear. Faust vents his
anger and chagrin with regard to the peasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and the irritating ding-dong-dell of the
vesper bell. He commissions Mephistopheles
to persuade the peasant to take the money
and to make him turn out of his wretched
hut. Mephistopheles and his mates go to
carry out the order. A few moments later
flames are seen to rise from the cottage and
chapel. Mephistopheles returns to relate
that the peasant and the wanderer proved
obstinate: in the scuffle the wanderer had
been killed; the cottage had caught fire,
and old Philemon and his wife had both
died of terror.</p>

<p>Faust turns upon Mephistopheles with
fierce anger and curses him. 'I meant
exchange!' he exclaims. 'I meant to <i>make
it good with money</i>! I meant not robbery
and murder. I curse the deed. Thou, not
I, shalt bear the guilt.'</p>

<p>Here I do not find it easy to follow
Faust's line of argument. Fair exchange
is certainly said to be no robbery&mdash;but this
theory of 'making everything good with
money' is one which the average foreigner
is apt to attribute especially to the average
Britisher, and it does not raise Faust in
one's estimation. I suppose he thinks he
is doing the poor old couple a blessing in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
disguise by ejecting them out of their
wretched hovel and presenting them with a
sum of money of perhaps ten times its value.</p>

<p>Possibly Goethe means it to be a specimen
of the kind of mistake that well-meaning
theoretical philanthropists are apt to commit
with their Juggernaut of Human Progress.
Faust is filled with great philanthropic ideas&mdash;but
perhaps he is a little apt to ignore
the individual. Anyhow his better self
'meant not robbery and murder' and is
perhaps quite justified in cursing its demonic
companion and giving him the whole of
the guilt.</p>

<p>The scene changes. It is midnight. Faust,
sleepless and restless, is pacing the hall in
his castle. Outside, on the castle terrace,
appear four phantom shapes clothed as
women in dusky robes. They are Want,
Guilt, Care, and Need. The four grey sisters
make halt before the castle. In hollow,
awe-inspiring tones they recite in turn their
dirge-like strains: they chant of gathering
clouds and darkness, and of their brother&mdash;Death.
They approach the door of the
castle hall. It is shut. Within lives a rich
man, and none of them may enter, not even
Guilt&mdash;none save only Care. She slips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
through the keyhole. Faust feels her unseen
presence.</p>

<p>'Is any one here?' he asks.</p>

<p>'The question demandeth <i>Yes</i>!'</p>

<p>'And thou ... who art thou?'</p>

<p>''Tis enough that I am here.'</p>

<p>'Avaunt!'</p>

<p>'I am where I should be.'</p>

<p>Faust defies the phantom. She, standing
there invisible, recites in tones like the knell
of a passing-bell the fate of a man haunted
by Care: how he gradually loses sight of his
high ideals and wanders blindly amid the
maze of worldly illusions&mdash;how he loses
faith and joy&mdash;how he starves amidst plenty&mdash;has
no certain aim in life&mdash;burdening himself
and others, breathing air that chokes
him, living a phantom life&mdash;a dead thing,
a death-in-life&mdash;supporting himself on a hope
that is no hope, but despair&mdash;never content,
never resigned, never knowing what he
should do, or what he himself wishes.</p>

<p>'Accursed spectres!' exclaims Faust.
'Thus ye ever treat the human race. From
demons, I know, it is scarce possible to free
oneself. But <i>thy</i> power, O Care&mdash;so great
and so insidious though it be, I will <i>not</i>
recognize it!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>'So <i>feel</i> it now!' answers the phantom.
'Throughout their whole existence men are
mostly <i>blind</i>&mdash;So let it be at last with
thee!'</p>

<p>She approaches, breathes in Faust's face,
and he is struck blind.</p>

<p>He stands there dazed and astounded.
Thick darkness has fallen upon him. At
last he speaks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Still deeper seems the night to surge around me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But in my inmost spirit all is light.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I'll rest not till the finished work has crown'd me.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>God's promise&mdash;that alone doth give me might.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He hastens forth, groping his way in
blindness, to call up his workmen. His life
is ending and he must end his work. It is
midnight, but the light within him makes
him think the day has dawned. In the
courtyard there are awaiting him Mephistopheles
and a band of Lemurs&mdash;horrible
skeleton-figures with shovels and torches.
They are digging his grave. Faust mistakes
the sound for that of his workmen,
and incites them to labour. He orders the
overseer, Mephistopheles, to press on with
the work ... to finish the last great moat&mdash;or
'Graben.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>'<i>Man spricht</i>,' answers Mephistopheles
<i>sotto voce</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'Man spricht, wie man mir Nachricht gab,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Von keinem</i> Graben&mdash;<i>doch vom Grab.'</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is no moat, no Graben, that is now
being dug, but a grave&mdash;a Grab.</p>

<p>Standing on the very verge of his grave,
Faust, reviewing the memories of his long
life, feels that <i>at last</i>, though old and
blind, with no more hopes in earthly existence,
he has won peace and happiness in
having worked for others and in having
given other human beings a measure of
independence and of that true liberty and
happiness which are gained only by honest
toil. He alone truly <i>possesses</i> and can <i>enjoy</i>
who has made a thing his own by earning it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yes, to this thought I hold with firm persistence;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The last result of wisdom stamps it true;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He only earns his freedom and existence</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who daily conquers them anew.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And such a throng I fain would see&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Would stand on a free soil, with people free.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Standing there, on the very edge of his
new-dug grave he blesses the present
moment and bids it stay. The fatal words
are spoken and according to the compact
his life must end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>He sinks lifeless to the ground. The
Lemurs lay him in the open grave.
Mephistopheles, triumphant, looks on and
exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>No joy could sate him, no delight suffice.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To grasp at empty shades was his endeavour.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The latest, poorest emptiest moment&mdash;this&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Poor fool, he tried to hold it fast for ever.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Me he resisted in such vigorous wise;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But Time is lord&mdash;and there the old man lies!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The clock stands still.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Stands still,' repeats a voice from heaven,
'still, silent, as the midnight.' 'It is
finished,' says Mephistopheles. 'Nay. 'Tis
but past,' answers the voice. 'Past!' exclaims
Mephistopheles; 'how <i>past</i> and yet
not <i>finished</i>?' ... He is enraged at the
suspicion that life, though past, may not
be <i>finished</i>&mdash;that Faust's human soul may
<i>yet</i> elude that hell to which he destines it ... that
of annihilation.</p>

<p>The Lemurs group themselves round the
grave and chant with hollow voices, such as
skeletons may be supposed to have, a funeral
dirge. Meantime Mephistopheles is busy
summoning his demons to keep watch over
the dead body, lest the soul should escape like
a mouse, or flicker up to heaven in a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
flamelet. Hideous forms of demons, fat
and thin, with straight and crooked horns,
tusked like boars and with claws like
vultures, come thronging in, while the jaw
of hell opens itself, showing in the distance
the fiery city of Satan.</p>

<p>At this moment a celestial glory is seen
descending from heaven and voices of
angels are heard singing a song of triumph
and salvation. They approach ever nearer&mdash;Mephistopheles
rages and curses, but in
vain. They come ever onward, casting
before them roses, the flowers of Paradise,
which burst in flame and scorch the demons,
who, rushing at their angelic adversaries
with their hellish prongs and forks and
launching vainly their missiles of hell-fire,
are hurled back by an invisible power and
gradually driven off the stage, plunging in
hideous ruin and combustion down headlong
into the jaws of hell.</p>

<p>Mephistopheles alone remains, foaming
in impotent rage. He is surrounded by
the choir of white-robed angels. He
stands powerless there, while they gather
to themselves Faust's immortal part and
ascend amidst songs of triumph to heaven.</p>

<p>Some of us, perhaps most of us&mdash;in certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
moods at least&mdash;feel inclined to close the
book here, as we do with <i>Hamlet</i> at the
words 'the rest is silence.' And this feeling
is all the stronger when we have
witnessed the stage decorator's pasteboard
heaven, where Apostles and Fathers are
posed artistically in rather perilous situations
amid rocks and pine-trees, or balance
themselves with evident anxiety mid-air
on pendent platforms representing clouds.
Altogether this stage-heaven is a very
uncomfortable and depressing kind of
place.</p>

<p>But when read in Goethe's poem and
regarded as an allegorical vision the scene
has a certain impressive grandeur, and some
of the hymns of adoration and triumph are
of exceeding beauty.</p>

<p>This Scene in Heaven opens with the
songs of the three great Fathers, the Pater
Ecstaticus, Pater Profundus, and Pater
Seraphicus, symbolizing the three stages
of human aspiration, namely ecstasy,
contemplation and seraphic love. The
Seraphic Father is of course St. Francis of
Assisi. In heaven, as he did on earth, he
sings of the revelation of Eternal Love.</p>

<p>Angels are now seen ascending and bearing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>Faust's immortal part, and as they rise
they sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The noble spirit now is free</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>And saved from evil scheming.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Whoe'er aspires unweariedly</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Is not beyond redeeming,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if he feels the grace of Love</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>That from on high is given</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The blessed hosts that wait above</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Shall welcome him to heaven.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His yet unawakened soul is greeted by the
heavenly choirs and by the three penitents,
the Magdalene, the woman of Samaria and
St. Mary of Egypt.</p>

<p>Then appears 'timidly stealing forth'
the glorified form of her who on earth was
called Gretchen. In words that remind one
of her former prayer of remorse and despair
in the Cathedral she offers her petition to the
Virgin:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>O Mary, hear me!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>From realms supernal</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Of light eternal</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Incline thy countenance upon my bliss!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>My loved, my lover,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>His trials over</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In yonder world, returns to me in this.</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The Virgin in her glory appears. She
addresses Gretchen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Come, raise thyself to higher spheres!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For he will follow when he feels thee near.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Gretchen soars up to the higher heaven,
and the soul of Faust, now awakening to
consciousness, rises also heavenward following
her, while the chorus of angels sings, in
words the beauty and power of which I
dare not mar by translation, telling how all
things earthly are but a vision, and how in
heaven the imperfect is made perfect and
the inconceivable wins attainment, and how
that which leads us upward and heavenward
is immortal love.</p>
